## We only support upgrades on our VPS plans

Due to the nature of virtual drives, it is always possible to enlarge a partition. Reducing partitions in size is not possible without complete data loss. For that reason, EDIS does not offer any downgrade options on its KVM plans.&#x20;

If you want to downgrade to a smaller plan, do the following:

1. Order a (smaller) product of your liking

2. Migrate data and applications to the new server

3. Cancel the other product.

<Note>
  EDIS Global does not work with context based VPS which usually use
  disk-quotas. EDIS Global provides fully virtualized KVM servers with virtual
  disks (like real harddrives/SSD drives). Reducing a drive in size immediately
  removes random parts of your drive where your valuable data is stored.
