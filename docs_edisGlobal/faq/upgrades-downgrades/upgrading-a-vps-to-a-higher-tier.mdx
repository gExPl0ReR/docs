## What is a VPS Upgrade?

A VPS Upgrade allows you to add additional resources to your VPS without the need of purchasing a fresh product.

- add **more RAM**
- add **additional vCPU cores**
- **increase the monthly traffic commitment**
- add **more disk space**

Adding RAM and vCPU cores require a cold-boot.
Traffic becomes available immediately, no actions required.

## How much is an upgrade?

_Example_: You upgrade from a EUR 4.99 SMART plan to the EUR 7.49 plan
Let's assume you want to upgrade after using the product for 1 week already.

In this example, you only pay EUR 1.92 extra. We only charge you the difference for the time left in the month, and we count in the full EUR 4.99 you already paid.

So, it's even cheaper than paying the full EUR 2.50 difference, and we definitely don't ask you to pay the full monthly price of the larger plan.

## Need more traffic than our plans offer?

If you are already on the largest tier, and you're running out of available traffic, you canÂ purchase traffic. EDIS offers the possibility to maintain aÂ traffic pool. It allows you to manually assign traffic to your VPS, or enable auto-hydration (automatic refills at 99% usage levels).
