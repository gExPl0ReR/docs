Traffic Pool

Running out of traffic can be a hassle. At EDIS Global, our traffic pool feature allows you to easily ‘hydrate’ your VPS with additional traffic as needed. With just a few clicks, allocate traffic from your pool and keep your server online without interruptions.

To make it easy for you, we created two traffic zones rather than having a variety of different traffic-prices for our almost 50 locations.

### **Why You'll Love Your Traffic Pool&#xA;**

✅ You are in complete control of the process of allocating and managing traffic.

✅ Maintain optimal functioning for your services.

✅ Take advantage of lowest price traffic rates (starting from EUR 6 /TB)

✅ Traffic in the pool never expires.

✅ Manually assign traffic to any KVM in your account which is running low on traffic.

✅ Automatic refill option individually configurable for every VPS ("Auto Hydration")

## Traffic Pool in the Traffic Information Window

In the Traffic Information window, you can monitor and manage your traffic pool allocation. This section provides a snapshot of your current traffic usage and remaining balance, with options for manual or automatic top-ups to ensure uninterrupted service.
