### What is IP spoofing?

IP spoofing refers to the practice of altering the source IP address in an IP packet header to make it appear as though the packet is coming from a different source than its true origin. This deceptive tactic can serve various malicious purposes.

### Dangers and Concerns

IP spoofing can undermine the trust and integrity of network communications, posing significant security risks. It can be used as part of more extensive attacks, deceive users, and evade security systems.
