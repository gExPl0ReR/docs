**How to Install LAMP with PostgreSQL and PostGIS on Ubuntu**

Welcome to EDIS Global VPS Hosting's comprehensive guide on setting up a LAMP environment but with a twist - we're swapping out the MySQL component for PostgreSQL and its spatial extension, PostGIS.

### Prerequisites:

1. An active EDIS Global VPS Hosting account.
2. A VPS running Ubuntu 20.04 or later.
3. Basic knowledge of terminal operations.

### Step-by-step Installation:

### 1. System Update:

Always ensure your server is up-to-date with the latest packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 2. Apache Installation:

Begin by installing the Apache web server:

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

To check Apache's status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

### 3. PHP Installation:

To install PHP and necessary extensions:

```bash
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-pgsql -y
```

Verify the PHP installation:

```bash
php -v
```

### 4. PostgreSQL and PostGIS Installation:

Install PostgreSQL along with some contrib packages:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib -y
```

Check the status of PostgreSQL:

```bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

Now, install PostGIS:

```bash
sudo apt install postgis postgresql-<VERSION>-postgis-3 -y
```

*Note:* Replace `<VERSION>` with your PostgreSQL version, e.g., `13` for PostgreSQL 13.

### 5. Database Setup:

Switch to the `postgres` user and enter the PostgreSQL environment:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Now, create your database and enable PostGIS on it:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
\c your_database_name
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

(Optional) To create a new user:

```sql
CREATE USER your_user_name WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_database_name TO your_user_name;
```

### 6. Securing Your Installation:

While setting up, always remember to secure your installations:

- For Apache: Set up firewalls, disable directory listings, and use SSL certificates.
- For PostgreSQL: Change default PostgreSQL user passwords, restrict remote access, and regularly backup your database.
- Regularly update all components of your stack.

### Conclusion:

You've successfully set up a LAMP stack with PostgreSQL and PostGIS on your EDIS Global VPS! This hybrid setup allows you to harness the power of traditional web hosting with the spatial capabilities of PostGIS. Always ensure to monitor, maintain, and back up your server for optimal performance and safety.
