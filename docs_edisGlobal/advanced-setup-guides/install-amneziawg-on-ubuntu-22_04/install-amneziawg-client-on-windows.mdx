WireGuard is a streamlined and efficient VPN protocol that is becoming increasingly popular due to its ease of use and strong security features. If you're looking to set up a Windows client to connect to a WireGuard VPN server running on Linux, AmnesiaWG provides a simplified and user-friendly approach. This guide will walk you through the process of transferring a prepared WireGuard client configuration from your Linux server to your Windows client using AmnesiaWG.

### Prerequisites

- A Linux server with WireGuard installed and a client configuration ready.
- A Windows client machine.
- Administrative access on both the server and the client.
- SSH access is configured on the server.

### Step 1: Installing AmnesiaWG on Windows

Before transferring the configuration file, you need to install AmnesiaWG on your Windows machine:

1. **Download AmnesiaWG:**
   - Visit the official [AmnesiaWG website](https://amnesiawg.com/download) and download the latest version of the software suitable for Windows.
2. **Install AmnesiaWG:**
   - Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Step 2: Securely Copying the Configuration File to the Windows Client

To transfer the client configuration securely from your Linux server to your Windows client, you can use an SCP client like WinSCP, a versatile tool for secure file transfer:

1. **Install WinSCP:**
   - Download WinSCP from [here](https://winscp.net/) and install it on your Windows machine.
2. **Transfer the Configuration File:**
   - Open WinSCP and start a new session entering your Linux server's IP address and your SSH credentials.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the WireGuard configuration file on the server.
   - Drag and drop the `.conf` file to a suitable directory on your Windows machine, such as `C:\\WireGuard\\Configs`.

### Step 3: Importing the Configuration into AmnesiaWG

With AmnesiaWG installed and the configuration file on your Windows client, you're ready to set up the connection:

1. **Launch AmnesiaWG:**
   - Open AmnesiaWG. You might need to run it as an administrator depending on your system settings.
2. **Import the Configuration File:**
   - In AmnesiaWG, click on "Import Configuration" and browse to the location where you saved the `.conf` file.
   - Select the file and import it. AmnesiaWG will automatically parse and add the configuration.

### Step 4: Connecting to the WireGuard Server

1. **Connect via AmnesiaWG:**
   - With the configuration file loaded, you'll see your new tunnel listed in AmnesiaWG. Click "Connect" to initiate the VPN connection.

### Step 5: Verifying the Connection

After connecting, it's essential to ensure everything is functioning correctly:

1. **Check Connection Status:**
   - AmnesiaWG will display the connection status. Ensure it indicates that the tunnel is active.
   - Optionally, visit a site like [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net/) to check your IP address and DNS, confirming that your traffic is routed through the VPN.

### Conclusion

Using AmnesiaWG simplifies setting up a WireGuard VPN on Windows. By following these steps, you can transfer a client configuration from a Linux server to a Windows client, ensuring a secure and straightforward connection to your VPN. This setup not only enhances your network security but also maintains privacy across your internet activities.
