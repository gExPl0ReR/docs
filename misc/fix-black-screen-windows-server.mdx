# Fix Black Screen Issue When Connecting to Windows Server

Encountering a black screen without a cursor when connecting to a Windows Server using Remote Desktop (RDP) can be frustrating. This guide provides two potential solutions: modifying the Windows Registry and trying alternative RDP clients.

***

## **Issue**: Black Screen After Connecting via Remote Desktop (RDP)

When connecting to your Windows Server using RDP, you may experience a black screen with no visible cursor or mouse. This issue is commonly caused by a configuration mismatch in the RDP client or the server.

***

## **Solution 1**: Modify the Windows Registry

Adjusting a specific registry setting can resolve the black screen issue.

### Steps to Modify the Registry:

1. **Open Command Prompt**:

   * Press `Win + R` to open the **Run** dialog box.

   * Type `cmd` and press **Enter** to launch the Command Prompt.


2. **Run the Registry Command**:
   Copy and paste the following command into the Command Prompt and press **Enter**:
   ```cmd
   reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client" /v "UseURCP" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f



**Restart your PC**:
   
Once the command has executed successfully, restart your computer.&#x20;
After the restart, try to connect again using RDP to see if the black screen issue is resolved.

### Step 2: Try Alternative RDP Clients

If the above fix didn’t work, consider using alternative remote desktop clients to connect to your Windows Server. These alternative tools might bypass the issue you’re facing with the native RDP client.
