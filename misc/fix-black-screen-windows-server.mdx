## Fix Black Screen When Connecting to Windows Server

Encountering a black screen without a cursor when connecting to a Windows Server using Remote Desktop (RDP) can be frustrating. This guide provides two potential solutions: modifying the Windows Registry and trying alternative RDP clients.

***

## **Issue**: Black Screen After Connecting via Remote Desktop (RDP)

When connecting to your Windows Server using RDP, you may experience a black screen with no visible cursor or mouse. This issue is commonly caused by a configuration mismatch in the RDP client or the server.

***

## **Solution 1**: Modify the Windows Registry

Adjusting a specific registry setting can resolve the black screen issue.

### Modify the Registry and Reboot

1. **Open Command Prompt**:

   * Press `Win + R` to open the **Run** dialog box.

   * Type `cmd` and press **Enter** to launch the Command Prompt.

2. **Run the Registry Command**:Copy and paste the following command into the Command Prompt and press **Enter**:

````powershell
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client" /v "UseURCP" /t REG\_DWORD /d 0 /f```
````

1. **Restart Windows Server**

Once the command has executed, restart your machine.&#x20;
After the restart, try to connect again using RDP to see if the black screen issue is resolved.

## Solution 2: Use Alternative RDP Clients
