## **EDIS Global VPS Reselling & Discount Structure**

At EDIS Global, we pride ourselves on providing top-tier VPS solutions to our clientele. Recognizing the value and reach of resellers, we've structured a reselling program that not only rewards volume but also provides the tools needed for seamless management and customer support.

### **Volume-Based Discounts**

The cornerstone of our reselling program, our volume-based discounts are divided into three tiers:

**Tier 1:** Maintain 50 active VPS services for a 5% discount.

**Tier 2:** 100 active VPS services earn you a 10% discount.

**Tier 3:** 150 or more active VPS services grant a generous 20% discount.

### **API Access for Enhanced Management**

Empowering our resellers, we provide full API access. Whether it's to integrate with your systems or create a custom admin panel, our API allows for flexibility and enhanced service delivery.

### **Application & Eligibility**

To access our reseller discounts, an application is essential. Once approved, we provide unique coupon codes to claim your discounts during the checkout process.

### **Division of Support Roles**

While resellers act as the primary point of contact for end-customers, EDIS Global stands by to offer outstanding technical support on the infrastructure level. From feature requests to payment related matters, we're here to support you.

### **Loyalty Discounts & Perks**

As a gesture of appreciation, we occasionally offer loyalty perks, like complimentary access to our bespoke IP address service, early access to new locations and a lot more.

### **Reseller Responsibilities**

A key component of our partnership is ensuring compliance and swift action on abuse messages, including copyright infringements, illegal activities, and SPAM, within 24 hours.
