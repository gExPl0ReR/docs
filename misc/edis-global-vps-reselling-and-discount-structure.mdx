## **EDIS Global VPS Reselling & Discount Structure**

At EDIS Global, we pride ourselves on providing top-tier VPS solutions to our clientele. Recognizing the value and reach of resellers, we've structured a reselling program that not only rewards volume but also provides the tools needed for seamless management and customer support.

### **Volume-Based Discounts**

Our reseller discounts are based on the number of active VPS services in your account — the more you manage, the higher your discount level.

| **Tier** | **Requirement** | **Discount** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Tier 1** | 50 active VPS services | **5 %** |
| **Tier 2** | 100 active VPS services | **10 %** |
| **Tier 3** | 150+ active VPS services | **20 %** |

Once your reseller tier is confirmed, your discount automatically applies to all future VPS orders placed using your reseller coupon code.

### **API Access for Enhanced Management**

Empowering our resellers, we provide full API access for complete integration and automation.
