Continue with the installation till you reach the empty **"Where do you want to install Windows?"** screen

<Check>Everything is good. ;-)</Check>

Now you need to load disk- and network- drivers EDIS provides on drive E:

![load_driver](/assets/Oua5O2cnO-l2geiD9lpRU_manual-windows-server-installation-3-29a2db7fd3.png)

Load the "client Virtio drivers".

This is important to be able to access the disk and network.

Click "**Load driver**" and "**Browse"**

Navigate to the driver CD (usually mounted on drive E:\\)

![browse_driver](/assets/6oW-8dqGMMyn6Rg0SFyI-_manual-windows-server-installation-4-e7954e59a1.png)

Now select the correct driver directory, according to your Windows version and architecture (x64 = AMD64, x86 = X86)

- For **Windows 2016** select the **2k16** folder
- For **Windows 2012 / R2** select the **2k12** or **2k12R2** folder
- For **Windows 2008 / R2** select the **2k8** or **2k8R2** folder

**For Windows 2012 and newer, only 64-bit drivers are available.**
Pick the AMD64 sub-folder.

Confirm your selection and click "**Next**"

![select_driver_to_install](/assets/WOSth5cRKQN6a-PS6dtnh_manual-windows-server-installation-5-3c500ef3e7.png)

Repeat the process in the "**viostor**" folder.

Click "**Next**"

You can now see your disk partition and you are able to resume the installation.

Once the installation is finished you will need to set your IP address manually.

IP addresses, subnet mask, gateway address, and nameservers are displayed in your VPS panel.

No further driver installations should be required.

Your Windows Server is now ready to use.
