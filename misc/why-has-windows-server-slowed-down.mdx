# Why Has Windows Server Slowed Down and How to Optimize It?

Many businesses depend on **Windows Server** for managing data and services. Over time, excessive resource usage, background processes, or misconfigurations can slow it down, affecting productivity. This guide covers common performance issues and practical solutions to keep your server running efficiently.

---

## 1. Checking Hardware Resources (CPU and RAM)

Windows Server is inherently **heavier than regular Windows versions** due to its extensive services and processes. Additionally, **servers typically lack dedicated GPUs**, meaning graphical processing relies on the **CPU and RAM**, which can increase resource usage and slow down the system.

âœ… **Things to check:**

- If **CPU usage is consistently above 80%**, heavy processes may be running, reducing server performance.
- If **RAM is fully utilized**, it indicates too many services and applications are running.

ðŸ”¹ **Minimum recommended resources for better Windows Server performance:**

- **RAM:** At least **4GB** for very basic setups, but **8GB or more** is highly recommended for stable performance.
- **CPU:** At least **dual-core (2 cores)** for minimal workloads, but **quad-core (4 cores) or higher** is preferable for better efficiency and stability.

ðŸ’¡ **Keep in mind:** While Windows Server may technically run on a dual-core CPU and 4GB of RAM, performance will be significantly limited, especially when running multiple services. Upgrading to at least **8GB RAM and a quad-core CPU** will provide a noticeable performance boost.

## 2. Managing Unnecessary Services

Some Windows Server services are enabled by default but are not always needed.

âœ… **How to disable unnecessary services?**

1. Open **Task Manager**.
2. Go to the **Services** tab and review running services.
3. Right-click on any unnecessary service and select **Stop**.
4. Open **Services.msc**, and set unnecessary services to **Manual** to prevent automatic startup.

---

## 3. Checking Background Applications and Startup Programs

Some applications launch automatically during boot and consume significant resources.

âœ… **How to manage startup programs?**

1. Open **Task Manager**.
2. Navigate to the **Startup** tab.
3. Disable unnecessary programs from launching automatically.

ðŸ”¹ **Additionally:** Check if heavy software like **antivirus programs and monitoring tools** are consuming too many resources.

## 4. Impact of Graphical Processing and Heavy Software on Server Performance

As mentioned earlier, servers generally **lack dedicated GPUs**, meaning all graphical tasks rely on **CPU and RAM**. Running graphical applications or heavy processing tasks can slow down system performance.

âœ… **Software that significantly impacts resource consumption:**

- **Trading software like MetaTrader**, which uses real-time and graphical charts.
- **Rendering or image editing software**, which heavily relies on CPU in servers without GPUs.
- **Dashboard management software with complex visualizations and animations.**

ðŸ”¹ **Solutions:**

- **Perform graphical processing on client machines instead of the server whenever possible.**
- **Use lightweight or web-based alternatives for data analysis and trading.**
- **If high graphical processing is necessary, consider a server with a dedicated GPU.**

## 5. Optimizing Network Settings and Bandwidth Usage

If the server is slow to respond, the issue may be network-related.

âœ… **What to do:**

- Use **`netstat -an`** in **Command Prompt** to check for unnecessary connections.
- Limit bandwidth usage for applications that do not require constant internet access.
- Update network drivers via **Device Manager**.

---

## 6. Updating Windows Server and Fixing System Issues

Sometimes, **not keeping Windows Server updated** can cause performance issues. Ensure that the latest security and system updates are installed.

âœ… **How to update Windows Server?**

1. Navigate to **Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update**.
2. Click on **Check for updates**.
3. If updates are available, install them and restart the system.

---

## 7. Cleaning Up Temporary Files and Optimizing Storage

Unnecessary files can slow down system performance.

âœ… **How to remove unnecessary files?**

1. Run **`cleanmgr`** in the Run command.
2. Select **Temporary files** and **Recycle Bin**.
3. Click **OK** to delete the files.
