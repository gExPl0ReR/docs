### Understanding VPS Server Location Changes

IP addresses are tied to specific server locations and cannot be transferred between geographical regions. Due to this technical limitation, changing the location of an existing server (relocating a server) is not feasible.

### Steps to Change VPS Server Location:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Cancellation:'>
    Cancel the VPS in the location you no longer need.
  </Step>
  <Step title='New Order:'>
    Order a VPS in any other location you need.
  </Step>
</Steps>
