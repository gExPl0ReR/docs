### Understanding VPS Server Location Changes

IP addresses are tied to specific server locations and cannot be transferred between geographical regions. Because of this technical limitation, an existing VPS cannot be physically moved to another location.

Instead, a location change is performed by reprovisioning the VPS in the new location.

### Free Location Change Within 24 Hours

Customers may request a **one-time free location change within 24 hours of the original VPS order**.

This option is useful if you:

- selected the wrong location
- need lower latency to a different region
- require a different geographic presence

When a location change is approved:

- The VPS will be reprovisioned in the new location
- The billing cycle and plan remain unchanged
- No refund is issued
- The original VPS will be permanently deleted

<LocationChangeRestrictions>

**Location change restrictions:**

- Available only within 24 hours of the original order
- Limited to one location change per VPS service
- Additional IPv4 addresses are not automatically migrated and may require re-approval
- Services flagged for abuse, spam, or policy violations are not eligible
- Subject to resource availability in the requested location

EDIS Global reserves the right to deny location change requests in cases of abuse prevention, fraud detection, or policy enforcement.

<Warning>

**Important:**  
Location changes involve reprovisioning a new VPS. Data, IP addresses, and configuration are not migrated automatically. Customers are responsible for creating backups before requesting a location change.

</Warning>
