### Understanding VPS Server Location Changes

IP addresses are tied to specific server locations and cannot be transferred between geographical regions. Due to this technical limitation, changing the location of an existing server (relocating a server) is not feasible.

### Steps to Change VPS Server Location:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Cancellation:'>
    Begin by canceling the VPS in the current location that you no longer
    desire.
  </Step>
  <Step title='New Order:'>
    Proceed to order a new VPS in the desired server location.
  </Step>
