If you need an additional network interface for your VPS, follow these steps:

## What is the Secondary Network Interface?
- EDIS Global's VPS comes with a single network interface (ethernet device) by default.
- You can purchase a **second network interface** as part of EDIS Global **Private VLAN Option* to enhance your VPS' networking capabilities.
- This interface is independent and can be configured with a private or public IP, depending on your needs.
- The secondary network interface will become available to **every VPS in a particular server location** after the **Private VLAN Option** has been purchased.

## How to Order a Secondary Network Interface
1. **Go to the Order Page**: [Purchase Private VLAN Option](https://manage.edisglobal.com/cart.php?gid=209)
2. **Choose the Server Location**: Make sure to select the correct location where your VPS is hosted.
3. **Complete the Purchase**: Follow the checkout process and pay the invoice.
4. **Provisioning**: Secondary network interfaces will be assigned to all VPS in the selected server location after payment (don't forget to power-cycle after order delivery)

## How to Configure the Secondary Network Interface

### For Linux:
1. Your main interface is typically `eth0`. The second interface will appear as `eth1`.
2. Restart your VPS to detect the new interface.
3. Assign an IP address to `eth1`, such as `192.168.1.10` or any private/public IP you have.

### For Windows:
1. After rebooting your VPS, Windows will detect the new network interface.
2. Configure the new interface with the required IP settings.

## Final Notes
Ensure that you select the correct server location when ordering the Private VLAN option
