## Verifying the Number of Cores Available to Windows

If you installed Windows on your EDIS Global VPS, you can check the number of CPU cores available to your OS using various methods. Here are a few common ways to see how many CPU cores your system has:

1. **Task Manager**:
   1. Right-click on the Taskbar and select "Task Manager".
   2. Click on the "Performance" tab.
   3. Select "CPU" from the left pane.
   4. Under the CPU graph, you will see information about your CPU. The number of cores and logical processors will be listed.
2. **System Information**:
   1. Press `Windows + R` keys simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.
   2. Type `msinfo32` and press Enter. This will open the System Information window.
   3. Under "System Summary", you should see "Processor". It will show details about your CPU, including the number of cores.
3. **Command Prompt**:
   1. Open Command Prompt (you can search for "cmd" in the Windows search bar and select the appropriate result).
   2. Type the following command and press Enter:
      `wmic cpu get NumberOfCores,NumberOfLogicalProcessors`

Any of these methods will provide you with information about the number of CPU cores in your system.
