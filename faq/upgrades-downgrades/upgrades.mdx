# ðŸ”¼ How to Upgrade Your VPS (Plans & Resources)

We offer **two types of upgrades** to improve your VPS performance:

---

## A. Upgrade to a Higher VPS Plan
Move to a larger, predefined plan with more RAM, vCPUs, and traffic.

## B. Upgrade Individual Resources
Stay on your current plan but add more RAM, vCPU, disk, or IP addresses as needed.

Upgrades are fast, affordable (prorated), and done without reinstalling your system.
Kindly be informed that we are currently not accepting downgrades â€” only upgrades are possible.

## Need more traffic than our plans offer?

If you are already on the largest tier, and you're running out of available traffic, you canÂ purchase traffic. EDIS offers the possibility to maintain aÂ traffic pool. It allows you to manually assign traffic to your VPS, or enable auto-hydration (automatic refills at 99% usage levels).
