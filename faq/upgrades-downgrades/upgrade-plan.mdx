# 🚀 Upgrade to a Higher VPS Plan

You can upgrade your VPS plan (e.g. from **KVM SMART** to **KVM STARTER**) anytime directly through the management portal.

## 🔄 What is a VPS Plan Upgrade?

A plan upgrade means moving your VPS to a **larger, predefined plan** with more resources like:
- More RAM
- More vCPU cores
- More traffic commitment

No need to reinstall or migrate! The upgrade happens in-place.



---

## 💶 How is it billed?

You only pay the **price difference** between the two plans, **prorated for the rest of the billing period**.  
You don’t pay the full price of the new plan — just the upgrade difference (you don't pay twice)

---

## 🛠️ How to order a Plan Upgrade

1. Log in to your [KVM Management Portal](https://manage.edisglobal.com/clientarea.php)
2. Find your VPS in the **Services** tab
3. Click the **“Upgrade”** button
4. Select the higher plan, confirm, and pay the invoice
5. Within 7 minutes after payment confirmation, the upgrade is processed and you’ll receive an email with instructions

## ⚙️ What happens next?

- **No IP change** or reinstall required  
- **Traffic upgrade** is available immediately  
- **RAM and vCPU** become active after a **cold reboot**  
- **Disk remains untouched** – you choose whether to resize your filesystem
