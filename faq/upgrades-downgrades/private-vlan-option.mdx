## Add a private network to your VPS (Private VLAN Option)

## What is a Private VLAN?
A **Private VLAN** allows you to establish a private and secure Ethernet connection between Virtual Private Servers (VPS) within a chosen server location. This feature enhances network segmentation and security while enabling efficient internal communication between VPS instances.

### Key Features:
- **Secondary Ethernet Interface**: Each VPS in the chosen server location receives an additional Ethernet interface.
- **VLAN Isolation**: A unique VLAN ID ensures that only VPS mapped to the same VLAN can communicate with each other through the user-configured private network.

## Requirements
### Single VPS Use Case
- If you only need a **secondary Ethernet interface**, a single VPS is sufficient.

### Multiple VPS Use Case
- If you require **private communication between VPS**, you need **at least two VPS** in the same server location.
- You can order multiple Private VLANs to create **complex network topologies**, assigning different VLAN IDs to different VPS groups.

## How to Order a Private VLAN
1. **Choose the Server Location**: Determine where you want to set up the Private VLAN.
2. **Order the Private VLAN Option**: Purchase it from our shop at the following link:

3. **Payment and Provisioning**: Once the invoice is paid, the Private VLAN option will be automatically provisioned and made available for all VPS in the chosen location.

## How to Assign your VPS to a Private VLAN
1. **Log in to the VPS Management Dashboard**.
2. **Click on "System Configuration"**.
3. **Scroll down to "VLAN Settings"**.
4. **Assign the VLAN ID** from the dropdown menu (e.g., 102).
5. **Apply the settings**.
6. **Power-cycle the VPS** to activate changes.
7. **Repeat for each VPS** that should be connected to the Private VLAN.
8. **Configure Private IP addresses** on your VPS' secondary NICs

## Benefits of Using a Private VLAN
- **Enhanced Security**: Traffic within a Private VLAN remains isolated from the public network.
- **No Traffic Charges**: Data transmitted via the Private VLAN does **not count** towards your monthly traffic allowance.
- **Scalability**: Multiple VLANs allow for **flexible and complex networking structures**, making them ideal for microservices, internal databases, or multi-server applications.
