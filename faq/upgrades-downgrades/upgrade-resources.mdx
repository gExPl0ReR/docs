# 🧩 Upgrade VPS Resources (RAM, CPU, Disk, IPs)

Need more resources without changing your entire plan?  
You can add more **RAM, vCPU cores, disk space (Drive Boost)** or **IP addresses** to your VPS.

---

## 🆚 What's the difference?

This is **not** a plan change. It's a **resource extension** of your current VPS.

You can:
- Add **more RAM**
- Add **more vCPU cores**
- Boost your **disk space** (Drive Boost)
- Add **IPv4 addresses**
- Mix and match any of the above

---

## 💶 How is it billed?

Just like plan upgrades:  
You only pay the **prorated amount** for the rest of your billing cycle.

## Need more traffic than our plans offer?

If you are already on the largest tier, and you're running out of available traffic, you can purchase traffic. EDIS Global offers the possibility to maintain a traffic pool. A traffic pool allows you to manually assign traffic to your VPS, or enable auto-hydration and automatic refill at 99% usage levels.
