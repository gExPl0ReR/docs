## 🚀 How to upgrade your Disk Space

Need more disk space? No problem!

Our largest standard VPS plan includes **100GB** of disk space, but if you require more, we offer flexible **Drive-Boosts** to extend your storage beyond your plan’s limits.

## 💾 Drive-Boost Option

| Extra Disk Space | Price (per month) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 10GB            | EUR 3.60          |
| 20GB            | EUR 6.90          |
| 30GB            | EUR 9.90          |
| 40GB            | EUR 13.50         |
| 50GB            | EUR 16.60         |
| 100GB           | EUR 29.00         |

> For even larger needs, you can add **additional increments of 100GB** at **EUR 29.00/month** each.

💡 **Tip:** Providing your **KVM ID** instead of the IP address helps us process your upgrade even faster.





## ❗️We never touch your partition


EDIS Global DOES NOT touch/resize your partition!

<Note>
  **YOU decide when you resize** your partition after we provision the drive-boost option.
