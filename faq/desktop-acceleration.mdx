## What to Expect from Desktop Workloads

EDIS Global VPS instances are optimised for **network services, server workloads, and always-on applications**. Our VPS **do not include GPUs or hardware-accelerated desktop graphics**.\
\
You can run Windows or Linux desktops, but performance depends fully on the CPU/RAM resources assigned to your VPS, because all graphics functions will need to be emulated by your CPU cores. \
\
Our servers work well for **productivity and administrative tasks**, webbrowsing, trading, ... but may feel slow with **GPU-dependent workloads**.
