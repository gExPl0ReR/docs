# Desktop Acceleration on our VPS

EDIS VPS instances are optimised for **network services, server workloads, and always-on applications**.  
Our VPS **do not include GPUs or hardware-accelerated desktop graphics**.  
You can run Windows or Linux desktops, but performance depends fully on the CPU/RAM resources assigned to your VPS.  
Our servers work well for **productivity and administrative tasks**, but may feel slow with **GPU-dependent workloads**.

If you require accelerated graphics, a VPS without GPU is not the right choice.
