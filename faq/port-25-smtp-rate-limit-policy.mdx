# Is Port 25 Open for Email?

At EDIS Global, we understand the importance of email services for our customers. While **port 25 is open** for outbound SMTP traffic, we implement a **rate limit of 8 packets per second (pps)** to ensure fair usage and protect the integrity of our network.

This limitation is sufficient for **regular email communication** and does not affect legitimate email-sending activities. Our rate-limiting policy is designed to prevent abuse while allowing normal email traffic to flow seamlessly.



## 🔒 Why Do We Rate-Limit Port 25?

We apply this rate limit to protect both our network and our customers from the negative impacts of spamming activities. Here are some key reasons for this policy:

### 🛡️ Protecting IP Reputation

Spam activity can result in our IP addresses being blacklisted by major email providers such as Gmail and Hotmail. Our rate-limiting strategy helps safeguard the reputation of our IP ranges, ensuring reliable email delivery for legitimate users.

### 🚫 Reducing Abuse Risk

Spammers often target unrestricted SMTP services. By applying this limit, we make it less attractive for potential abusers to exploit our network for sending bulk spam emails.

### ⚖️ Fair Usage for All Customers

By limiting SMTP traffic evenly across all accounts created after February 24, 2025, we ensure that no individual client can consume disproportionate resources, protecting overall service quality.

### 🔒 Simplifying Compliance and Reducing Legal Risks

While authorities may not directly intervene in spam complaints, a high volume of spam-related abuse can bring regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. This policy helps mitigate those risks.



## ⚙️ What Does This Mean for You?

- **Port 25 is open by default** for outbound email traffic.
- SMTP traffic is **rate-limited to 8 packets per second (pps)**, which is more than enough for standard email usage.
- This limit is automatically applied to all **newly generated accounts starting February 24, 2025**.



## 🚫 Can the Rate Limit Be Lifted?

No. The **rate limit on port 25 is permanent** and applies to all customers equally, regardless of payment method or account history. This policy ensures the stability and reputation of our services for all users.



## ❓ Need Higher Email Capacity?

If your use case requires sending large volumes of email, we recommend using a specialized email delivery service that is designed for bulk mailing.



## 📌 Important Reminders

- Be mindful of our strict **NO SPAM policy**.
- Any spam complaints can result in **account termination without eligibility for a refund**.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
