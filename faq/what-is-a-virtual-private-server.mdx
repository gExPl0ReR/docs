## What is a VPS?

A **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** is a type of hosting that gives you your own **dedicated share of a physical server**, with guaranteed resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage. Unlike shared hosting, a VPS offers **isolation, root access, and full customization**—all at a fraction of the cost of a dedicated server.  

With a VPS, you can install any software, run multiple services, and scale resources as your needs grow.
