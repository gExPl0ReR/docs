### Crypto Currencies

**Monero (XMR)** is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that offers untraceable and anonymous transactions, providing a significant advantage in the digital currency space by not recording transaction details, unlike Bitcoin.
Mobile Payment Technologies

### Digital wallet and mobile payment services

EDIS Global accepts payments via **Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Alipay**.

###

### **Bank Payment Policies**

**Bank Transfers**: The VPS platform operated by EDIS Global is designed for full automation, which currently does not extend to the processing of inbound payments via bank transfers.

However, the acceptance of payments through bank transfer (utilizing SWIFT/IBAN) is permitted under specific circumstances, as outlined below:

1. **Account Credit Top-ups**

   Initiating from a minimum of EUR 250.

2. **Annual Invoice Settlements**

   This can be done through bank transfers, provided there is a prior agreement established with our support team.

3. **Emergency Payments**

   In cases where alternative payment methods are temporarily unavailable.

For detailed guidance and to ensure proper coordination, please reach out to our support team.

### **SEPA/ACH** **direct debits**

Due to the uncertain processing times, elevated transaction costs, and increased risk of misuse, SEPA and ACH direct debit transactions are not facilitated.
