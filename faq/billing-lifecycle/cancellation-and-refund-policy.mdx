### Policy Restrictions

- **Refund Limit**

  A maximum of 1 refund request per customer are allowed within a 12-month period. Additional requests beyond this limit will not be considered.

- **Eligibility**

  Refund requests received after the 24-hour timeframe will not be considered. The refund policy does not apply if you purchased special/discounted deals, made use of a discount code, revoked a cancellation request, added pool-traffic to a service, or ordered an upgrade for the plan.

</Note>

### **Review and Eligibility**:

- Our team will review your request to determine if you qualify for a refund.
- Should you meet the eligibility criteria, we'll proceed with the termination of the service, create a credit note (as required by law), and initiate a refund to your original payment method.

### **Payment Method Details**:

- For refunds related to cryptocurrency payments, kindly provide your wallet address to facilitate the refund process.
- While refunds are processed promptly upon receiving written confirmation from our team, the timeframe in which it appears on your statement can vary based on your payment method. For instance, **AliPay** transactions may reflect after up to 10 days.

### **Additional Information**:

- It's crucial to note that any refund request submitted after 24 hours from the time of purchase will not be considered. However, you retain the right to cancel your product at any time.
- Requests missing an IP address or Support PIN cannot be processed.
- The refund policy does not cover special or discounted deals, instances where discount codes were applied, upon revocation of a cancellation request, after adding pool-traffic to a service, or post ordering an upgrade for the plan.
- We understand that refunds may occasionally be necessary. Therefore, a maximum of 2 refund requests per customer are allowed within a 12-month period. Additional requests beyond this limit will not be considered.
