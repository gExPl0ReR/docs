## How to Pay Invoices with Account Credit

Account credit is applied automatically to **future invoices**.

If you top up your account credit **after an invoice has already been created**, that invoice must be paid **manually**.

To do this, log in to the **Client Panel**, then go to **Billing → My Invoices** and open the relevant invoice.  
On the invoice page, you will see a green **Apply Credit** section at the top showing your available balance.  
Enter the amount you want to apply and click **Apply Credit** to reduce the invoice total.

## Automated Billing

EDIS Global supports several payment methods. Some are better suited for **fully automated billing**, while others work best with a bit of planning.

### Credit Cards

When you pay an invoice with your credit card, your card is safely stored with our payment provider Stripe.

A reference token is stored in your account, which allows us to securely debit your card exactly when an invoice is due.

Renewal invoices are charged automatically.  
New orders are also charged automatically and provisioned in near real-time.

---

### Account Credit

Top up your account to ensure renewal invoices are automatically funded from your account balance.

New orders are also funded from your account credit and delivered in near real-time.

You only need to make sure that sufficient funds are available in your account.

Account credit can be funded using credit cards, PayPal, direct debit, or cryptocurrency payments.

### Direct Debit

We can help set up a SEPA direct debit mandate.  
Future invoices will be debited automatically.

New orders are delivered once funds have settled (usually 4–5 days after ordering).

SEPA Direct Debit is not ideal if you require immediate service delivery.  
However, it can be used to top up account credit as a powerful combination when planned properly.

We can assist with creating a 1 EUR test invoice to set up the mandate.  
Invoices created during the setup phase must be handled manually to avoid suspension.

### PayPal Subscriptions

PayPal subscriptions work well for private use cases with a limited number of services.

For business use cases involving frequent upgrades, cancellations, or re-orders, PayPal subscriptions can become difficult to manage.

In such cases, credit card payments or account credit are recommended.

When transitioning away from PayPal subscriptions:
- Cancel existing subscriptions in your PayPal account
- Monitor renewal invoices during the transition
- Pay invoices manually if needed to avoid service suspension
