## How to Pay Invoices with Account Credit

At the bottom, we note down that credit is applied automatically to future invoices.  
Existing invoices must be paid manually, if account credit has been topped-up after the invoice was created.

## Setting up a Fully Automated Payment Workflow

What works best:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Credit Cards 🥇🥇🥇">
    When you pay an invoice with your credit card, your card is safely stored with our payment provider Stripe.  
    A reference token is stored in your account, which allows us to securely debit your card, capturing the payment exactly when an invoice is due.  

    Renewal invoices are debited automatically and your card is charged automatically for new orders too: provisioning of newly ordered services happens in near-realtime.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Account Credit 🥇🥇🥇">
    Top-Up your account to make sure that all renewal invoices will be automatically funded/paid from your account balance.  
    New orders will also be funded from your account's credit balance, and delivered in near real-time.  

    You only need to make sure to have sufficient funds in your account and it will be a smooth ride.  

    You can fund your account credit balance with credit cards, Paypal, by direct debit or with crypto currency payments.

  <Card title="Direct Debit 🥇🥇 (EDIS Global, not available in EDBB)">
    We can help you setting up a SEPA direct debit mandate. Future invoices will be debited from your account in a timely manner.  
    New orders will be delivered once funds have settled (usually 4 to 5 days after placing an order).  

    SEPA Direct Debit is not ideal if you expect newly ordered services to be delivered immediately.  
    Nevertheless, you can use Direct Debit to top-up your Account Credit balance. Just plan well and this can be powerful combination.  

    (we can help creating a 1 EUR test invoice to set-up the mandate. once payment clears, we help transitioning services to the SEPA mandate. any invoices received while the SEPA mandate is being set-up must be taken care of manually in order not to get any services suspended).
  </Card>

  <Card title="PayPal Subscriptions 🥇">
    Paypal subscriptions do work well if you regularly renew a limited number of services (private use-cases).  

    If you regularly upgrade, cancel, re-order (business use-cases, resellers), working with Paypal subscriptions can get a bit messy and would not lead to a smooth experience.  

    Opt for credit card payments or work with account credit instead. Once transitioning away from Paypal subscriptions, is is important to cancel all existing PayPal subscriptions in your PayPal account, monitor renewal invoices in the transition period (make sure to manually pay invoices in order not to get any services suspended), then use a new payment methog.
