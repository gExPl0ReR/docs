## Transition from Chaotic Payments to Automated Billing

As accounts grow over time, billing setups often evolve organically — and not always in a clean or predictable way.

Based on our experience with customers**over more than a decade** , we see a very typical pattern emerge as businesses scale.

This guide explains:

- how billing setups usually become complex,
- why this causes confusion for accounting,
- and how to safely transition to a **hassle-free, automated billing workflow**.

If you or your accountant feel that billing has become hard to follow, this guide is for you.

## A Typical Growth Path (What Usually Happens)

Many accounts start simple and become more complex over time.

```

### What this looks like in practice

- Services are initially paid via **PayPal**
- Customers sign up for **PayPal subscriptions**
- Subscriptions keep sending the **same recurring amount**, even if services change
- Over time, customers also make **manual PayPal or credit card payments**
- Forgotten PayPal subscriptions continue to send funds
- Duplicate payments are added to **account credit**
- Account credit is applied automatically to new invoices
- Accounting visibility decreases as services grow

## First Check: Review Your Account Credit Balance

If you see account credit that you did **not intentionally add**, this is often caused by:

- active or forgotten PayPal subscriptions, in combination with
- overlapping manual payments

---

## The Most Important Step: Cancel PayPal Subscriptions

Before doing anything else, review your PayPal account and cancel all active subscriptions.

This ensures no automated payments continue to arrive unexpectedly. It is not us charging your Paypal account - it is Paypal repeatedly making payments to us.

## Understanding Account Credit During the Transition

Account credit is applied automatically to new invoices and can also be used for new orders. Your credit balance is displayed in the control panel.

## You Are Already Halfway There

Once PayPal subscriptions are cancelled and account credit is being reduced intentionally, you are already more than halfway toward a clean billing setup.

## The Transition Phase: What to Watch Closely

- Monitor invoices carefully
- Watch for the point where remaining credit is fully used
- Activate automated billing before invoices become overdue

---

## Moving to SEPA Direct Debit (Optional)

SEPA Direct Debit should be prepared in advance.

- Create a small account credit top-up (e.g. €5)
- Choose SEPA Direct Debit as payment method
- Complete mandate setup
- Contact support after settlement, to get services moved to the new payment method

Important notes:

- Not suitable for instant delivery
- Services activate after settlement (4–5 days)
- Pay all existing invoices manually before switching

---

## Optional: Locking Account Credit During Billing

EDIS Global can lock account credit during the billing window to avoid automatic application. This is useful if you would like to combine SEPA Direct Debit with account credit. Renewal invoices will be debited from your bank account, whil the account credit balance remains at your disposal for new purchases with near real-time delivery.
