# Automated Currency Conversion

All our prices and payments for EDIS Global services are in **EUR (€)**.  You can use various payment methods - the conversion to EUR will be handled automatically, no matter which currency you hold.

## Credit Card Payments
- When paying with a **Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, or other credit cards**, your bank **automatically converts** the amount from **EUR (€) to your card's currency** (e.g., USD, GBP, etc.).  
- The exchange rate and any applicable conversion fees are determined by **your bank or card issuer**.

## PayPal Payments
- If you choose **PayPal**, the PayPal payment dialogue will display the amount in your **account currency**, and in **EUR (€)** right below.
- When completing the payment, **PayPal will automatically charge your PayPal balance in your local currency (e.g., USD, GBP, etc.)** using its **own exchange rates**.  
- You can review the exchange in the PayPal payment dialogue, before executing the transaction.

## Cryptocurrency Payments (via Cryptomus)
- We support **crypto payments** through our partner **Cryptomus**, a secure crypto clearing provider.  
- When selecting **Cryptocurrency as your payment method**, you simply choose **the crypto you want to pay with (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, etc.)**.  
- **Cryptomus automatically calculates the equivalent amount in your selected crypto** and provides the **wallet address** for payment.  
- The payment amount (exchange rate) is **locked at the moment of the transaction**, preventing rate fluctuations.

> **Important Note:** Since exchange rates vary depending on the payment provider, we recommend reviewing the final amount before confirming your payment.
