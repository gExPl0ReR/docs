  **Transferring services between accounts is not possible!**

  Due to security policies, KVM machines are permanently tied to the account they were created under. This ensures security and functionality. Transfers are not feasible because KVM services cannot operate under a different account.
</Note>

## Why Service Transfers Are Not Possible

Transferring services between accounts is not possible because each **KVM ID** (the unique identifier for each virtual machine) is permanently tied to the account it was created under. This is not a matter of policy but rather a technical and security limitation of our system. Once a KVM ID is created, it cannot be reassigned to a different account without losing critical functionality.

## Security and Functionality at the Core

Our systems are designed to ensure the highest level of security for all our customers. The account-based attachment of KVM machines serves the following purposes:

1. **Prevent Unauthorized Access:** By binding KVM IDs to a single account, we ensure that only the account owner has access to manage the virtual machines.

2. **Preserve System Integrity:** Moving a KVM ID to another account disrupts the linkage required for the service to function correctly.

3. **Maintain Service Reliability:** The connection between the account and its associated KVM IDs is critical for seamless operation and backend processes.

### Frequently Asked Question: "Why Canâ€™t You Just Move It?"

We understand that this limitation may cause inconvenience in some situations. However, our infrastructure does not allow such transfers. Attempting to migrate a KVM service to another account would render it non-functional and compromise its integrity.

> **Note:** This limitation is in place to safeguard both the customer and the system from any potential risks associated with unauthorized access or data breaches.

### What Are My Options?

If you require services for a different account, the best approach is to create a new KVM machine under the desired account. While this may involve some setup effort, it ensures the security and functionality of your services.
