### What is VAT?

Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax applied to goods and services in EU countries. Different countries have different VAT rates. For example, Hungary has the highest standard rate at 27%, while Luxembourg has the lowest at 16%.

### Do I Need to Pay VAT?&#x20;

**Cyprus-based Customers:** Both private and business customers in Cyprus will be charged the 19% local VAT, as EDIS Global is based in Cyprus.

**EU Residents Outside Cyprus:** If you’re an EU resident outside Cyprus, you’ll be charged the VAT rate applicable in your country of residence when ordering.

**EU Companies without a Valid VAT ID:** EU companies without a valid VAT ID will be charged their local VAT rate. These businesses are eligible for full input tax deduction, just like receiving an invoice from a local company.

**Outside the EU**: If you live outside the EU or in certain EU areas with special tax status, no VAT will be applied to your invoice.

### Business Customers (Companies)

**Cyprus-based Companies**: Business customers registered in Cyprus will always be charged 19% VAT.

**EU-based Companies with a Valid VAT ID**: If your company is registered in the EU and has a valid EU VAT ID, VAT will not be charged - the “reverse charge” mechanism is applied.

**Non-EU Companies**: If your company is based outside the EU, no VAT is added to your invoice.
