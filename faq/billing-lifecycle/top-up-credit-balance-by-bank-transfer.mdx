### How to Top-Up Your Account Balance Through Bank Payment

Top-up your account balance quickly and securely using bank transfers. Follow this step-by-step guide to ensure your funds are added promptly to your account.

### Step 1: Generate Your Invoice

To begin, log into your [client dashboard](https://manage.edisglobal.com/clientarea.php?action=addfunds) and navigate to **Billing** then click on **Add Funds**. This function allows you to generate a top-up invoice which is necessary for the proper processing and tracking of your payment.

### Step 2: Obtain Bank Details

You will find the necessary bank account details in the .pdf documents at the end of this article. There are separate details provided for payments in Euro (EUR) and U.S. Dollars (USD). Please ensure you use the correct account details corresponding to your currency of choice to avoid any conversion fees or delays.

### Step 3: Make the Bank Payment

With your invoice ready and the correct bank details at hand, proceed to make the bank transfer. It is crucial to use the pro forma invoice number (e.g., 400xx) as the payment reference. This reference number is vital as it helps in identifying and verifying your transaction efficiently.

### Step 4: Currency Conversion (If Applicable)

If you are transferring funds in USD, note that the conversion to EUR will be executed based on the Belgium National Bank's interbank rate. This ensures that your payment is converted at a fair and standardized rate.

### Step 5: Confirmation of Funds Received

Once your transfer has been made, there is nothing more you need to do. We will confirm the receipt of funds and manually apply the payment to your invoice. You will receive a notification once your account balance has been updated.

### Additional Information

- **Processing Time:** Bank transfers can take a few business days to be processed. Please allow some time for the funds to reflect in your account balance.
