  Our services are based on **MONTHLY subscriptions** rather than daily. We
  understand that sometimes you may need to discontinue a service prior to the
  completion of the subscription period. Unfortunately, in those cases, **we
  cannot provide a refund** for any portion of the subscription that has already
  been paid. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
