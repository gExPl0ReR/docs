## Is it possible to pay via bank transfer?

The VPS platform operated by EDIS Global is designed for full automation, which currently does not extend to the processing of inbound payments via bank transfers.

However, the acceptance of payments through bank transfer (utilizing SWIFT/IBAN) is permitted under specific circumstances.
