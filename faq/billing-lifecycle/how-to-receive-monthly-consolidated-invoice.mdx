## Simplify Your Accounting with a Single Monthly Invoice

Many customers have asked: _“Can we get one monthly invoice instead of many individual ones? It would really simplify our accounting.”_ At EDIS Global, we understand this need, so we offer the option to consolidate your billing.

### **How It Works**

We can set a specific billing date to group all your existing services onto one monthly invoice. Any new services added will be billed separately unless you request to align them with your consolidated billing date.

In simple terms, all your existing services will be billed on the same day every month. You’ll receive one **adjustment invoice** (a pro-rata adjustment). By paying this adjustment invoice, our system automatically adjusts all due dates to the agreed billing date.

### **How to Get Started**

If this sounds like a good solution for you, just contact us and let us know. Be sure to mention if you prefer your billing date to be at the start or the middle of the month.
