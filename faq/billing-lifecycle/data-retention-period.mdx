## What Is Your Data Retention Period?

EDIS Global maintains specific data retention policies to ensure data security and compliance. Below are the key details regarding data retention for cancelled services and backups.

---

## 1. Cancelled Services

- **VPS Data Deletion**: If a VPS service is cancelled, all associated data is permanently deleted **6 days after the service termination date**.

- **Customer Responsibility**: It's crucial to back up your data **before** requesting cancellation, as data deletion is irreversible after this period.

## 2. Backups

- **QCOW2 Image Backup**: When you request a downloadable `.qcow2` image backup of your VPS, a **30-day window** is provided to download and store your backup.

- **Service Fee**:  A fee of **EUR 25** is charged for generating the backup.

- **Download Link:**  A secure, password-protected download link will be provided, valid for 30 days. After this period, the backup will be automatically deleted for security and privacy reasons.

- **Recommendation**: It's recommended to manage your machines and regularly back up your server data.
