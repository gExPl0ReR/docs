## Introduction

EDIS Global uses Cryptomus as a cryptocurrency payment provider. Like Stripe or WorldPay for credit cards, Cryptomus processes crypto payments, applies necessary checks, and may block transactions if flagged on the blockchain (AMLBot).

## When "Your payment is blocked"

In rare cases, payments can get flagged on the blockchain and must be blocked by the payment provider.
If you encounter a message that "**Your payment is blocked**", follow the onscreen instructions and **complete the questionnaire**.

## FAQs

### Who Has Access to Blocked Funds?

Neither Cryptomus nor EDIS Global have access to blocked funds.

### Are Funds Lost Forever?

No, funds are not lost. Funds will be released when the payer complies by filling the questionnaire and indicating the source of funds (SOF). Cryptomus will then release the payment to the payee, or return funds to the payer.
