## Understanding Payment Reservations vs. Captured Payments

During payment, a timeout can occur - often related to a poor internet or VPN connection. When this happens during the credit card checkout process, only the **initial phase** of the payment is completed. This initial phase is known as a **reservation** - the amount is temporarily blocked on the credit card, but not actually charged. 

The **second phase**, called **capturing**, would finalize the payment. But in this case, the connection or session was no longer valid, or the customer reloaded the page and restarted the checkout. As a result, only the reservation remained without being completed.

### 🔒 What is a Reservation?

A **reservation** (also called an **uncaptured payment**) happens when a payment is initiated but **not completed**. It temporarily **reduces the available balance** on your credit card, but:

- EDIS Global does **not receive any money**
- The amount is **only blocked**
- The funds are **guaranteed for us** but not yet transferred
- If we don’t capture it manually, the reservation **automatically disappears within 7 days**
- After expiration, **the line vanishes from your credit card statement**
- A reservation **cannot be refunded**, because the money was never taken from your card.

### ✅ What is a Captured Payment?

A **captured payment** is a **successful charge** where:

- EDIS Global has **received the money**
- Your available credit on your card is reduced
- The charge appears on your credit card statement
- If refunded, a **second line will appear** (credit/refund)

Captured payments **can be refunded**, and once refunded, **we no longer have the money**.

### 📝 Real-World Example

Let’s say a customer tries to pay EUR 5 but reloads the page after authorizing the payment. What happens?

- A **reservation** is created for EUR 5 → Balance reduced, but no payment completed.
- The customer retries, and a new EUR 5 **captured** payment is made → EDIS gets the funds.
- Now, if the customer requests a refund for the successful payment, a **credit line** appears in their statement.
- The original reservation (failed payment attempt) **disappears after 7 days** automatically.
