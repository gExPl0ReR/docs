## Pay Invoices with Account Credit

Account credit is applied automatically to **future invoices**.

If you topped-up your account **after you received an invoice**, these invoice must be paid **manually**.

To pay invoices with from your account credit balance, log in to the **Client Portal**, then navigate to **Billing → My Invoices** and open the relevant invoice.\
On the invoice page, you will see a green **Apply Credit** section at the top showing your available balance.\
Enter the invoice amount (or the credit amount you would like to transfer to that invoice), and click **Apply Credit**.
