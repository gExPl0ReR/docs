## Pay Invoices with Account Credit

**Existing invoices** must be paid **manually **by applying account credit.\
**Future invoices** will be paid from account credit **automatically**. 

To pay an invoice with from your credit balance, log in to the **Client Portal**, then navigate to **Billing → My Invoices** and open the relevant invoice.\
\
On the invoice page, you will see a green **Apply Credit** section at the top showing your available balance. Enter the invoice amount (or the amount of credit you would like to apply to that invoice), and click **Apply Credit**.
