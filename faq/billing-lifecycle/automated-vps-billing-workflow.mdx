## ⏳ Simplified, Automated VPS Billing Workflow

This timetable shows when we send invoices, reminders, when we suspend services, terminate plans, and when we delete VPS from our disks if an invoice does not receive its payment.

<Note>
  ## **Client Responsibility Notice**

  VPS customers are solely responsible for:

  * Managing their virtual machines

  * Creating regular backups of their servers

  * Securing all important data

  * Keeping payment methods updated to avoid suspension and deletion

  EDIS Global strongly recommends maintaining backups of all critical information.
