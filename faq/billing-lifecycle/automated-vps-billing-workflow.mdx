## Automated VPS Billing Workflow

We want to provide you with a clear overview of our automated VPS billing process, including when we generate invoices, process credit card payments, send reminders, and what occurs if an invoice remains unpaid.

1. **Invoice Generation**

   * Generated 7 days before the due date

2. **Credit Card Processing**

   * Automated capture 4 days before the due date

3. **Payment Reminders**

   * First friendly reminder: 2 days before the due date

   * Overdue reminders: Sent 1, 2, and 3 days after the due date

4. **Service Actions**

   * **Service Suspension**: Occurs 3 days after the due date

   * **Service Termination**: Takes place 8 days after the due date (**all data is permanently wiped**)

## 🛠 Service Recovery Options

### **✅ If Your Invoice is Unpaid**&#xA;

If your VPS was terminated but the invoice in your account is still **marked UNPAID** (and not cancelled), you **may** be able to restore your VPS.

#### Steps to Restore Your VPS

&#x9;1\.	**Make the payment immediately** (first step)

&#x9;2\.	**Contact Support**  to request data restoration  (after payment)

### **❌ If Your Invoice is Cancelled**

#### Service Recovery Not Available

&#x9;•	If your invoice is **marked CANCELLED**, **recovery is NOT possible**.

&#x9;•	Your VPS and **all data are permanently deleted**.
