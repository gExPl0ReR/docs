## Fully automated EDIS Global VPS billing workflow

We would like to provide you with a brief overview of our automated VPS billing procedure, when we create invoices, when we capture payments from cards, when we send our reminders and what happens when an invoice does not receive its payment.

1. **Invoice generation:** 7 days prior to the due date

2. **Credit card captures:** 4 days prior to the due date

3. **Friendly reminder:** first friendly reminder, 2 days prior to the due date

4. **Overdue reminders:** 1, 2, and 3 days after the due date

5. **Service Suspension:** 3 days after the due date

6. **Service Termination:** 8 days after the due date (**all data is wiped**)

## Can a terminated service be restored?

If your invoice is NOT YET CANCELLED, there is a good chance that we are able to restore your data. Make the payment immediately and inform our team about your payment. Once you see a cancelled invoice in your account, it is too late to recover the service.

<Note>
  Customers are solely responsible for managing their machines and making
  backups of their servers and all their important data!
