## 🚀 Automated VPS Billing Workflow

This timeline shows when we send reminders, suspend services, terminate subscriptions, and finally delete VPS data if an invoice remains unpaid.



**🚀 Simplified VPS Billing Workflow**



**Key Milestones:**

| **Day** | **Event**            | **Action**                     |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **-7**  | 🧾 Invoice Created    | Invoice generated              |
| **-2**  | ✉️ Friendly Reminder  | First unpaid reminder sent     |
| **0**   | 📅 Due Date           | Payment due                    |
| **+1**  | ⚠️ Overdue Reminder 1 | First overdue reminder         |
| **+2**  | ⚠️ Overdue Reminder 2 | Second overdue reminder        |
| **+3**  | ⚠️ Overdue Reminder 3 | Third overdue reminder         |
| **+7**  | ⏸️ Service Suspension | VPS access disabled            |
| **+14** | ❌ Termination        | VPS Agreements ends            |
| **+20** | 🗑️ Data Deletion      | Final deletion of all VPS data |



**✅ Recovery Options:**

​	•	**After Termination (Invoice status UNPAID):**

​	•	Pay immediately, Service will reactivate after we receive the payment

​	•	**After Termination (Invoice status CANCELLED):**

​	•	Recovery is **NOT possible**.

​	•	All data is **permanently lost**.

**🔔 Important:**

​	•	Once the invoice is **Cancelled**, **no recovery** of your VPS or data is possible.

​	•	Keep your payment methods updated to avoid suspension and deletion.

​	•	Regular backups are your responsibility.



Would you like me to generate a Mermaid timeline or Gantt diagram for this as well?
