## Understanding EDIS Global's Automated VPS Billing Workflow

We want to provide you with a clear overview of our automated VPS billing process, including when we generate invoices, process credit card payments, send reminders, and what occurs if an invoice remains unpaid.

### Billing Timeline

1. **Invoice Generation**
   - Generated 7 days before the due date
   
2. **Credit Card Processing**
   - Automated capture 4 days before the due date
   
3. **Payment Reminders**
   - First friendly reminder: 2 days before the due date
   - Overdue reminders: Sent 1, 2, and 3 days after the due date
   
4. **Service Actions**
   - Service Suspension: Occurs 3 days after the due date
   - Service Termination: Takes place 8 days after the due date (**all data is permanently wiped**)

### Service Recovery Options

If your VPS has been terminated, but your invoice is **not yet cancelled**, there may be an opportunity to restore your data. To attempt recovery:

1. Make the payment immediately
2. Contact our support team to notify us of your payment

**Important:** Once an invoice shows as "cancelled" in your account, data recovery is no longer possible.

<Note>
**Client Responsibility Notice**

VPS customers are solely responsible for:
- Managing their virtual machines
- Creating regular backups of their servers
- Securing all important data

EDIS Global strongly recommends maintaining current backups of all critical information.
