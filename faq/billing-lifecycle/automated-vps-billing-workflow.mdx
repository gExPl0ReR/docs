## 🚀 Automated VPS Billing Workflow

This timeline shows when we send invoices, reminders, when we suspend services, terminate plans, and when we finally delete VPS data if an invoice remains unpaid.

🛠 Service Recovery Options



### **✅ If Your Invoice still shows as Unpaid**

​Pay immediately, your service will reactivate automatically after we receive the payment

<Note>
  ### **Client Responsibility Notice**

  VPS customers are solely responsible for:

  * Managing their virtual machines

  * Creating regular backups of their servers

  * Securing all important data

  * Keeping payment methods updated to avoid suspension and deletion




  EDIS Global strongly recommends maintaining backups of all critical information.
