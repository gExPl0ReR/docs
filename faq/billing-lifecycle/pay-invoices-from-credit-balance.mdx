## Pay Invoices with Account Credit

Account credit can be used to pay invoices from your Client Portal.

### Important

- **Future invoices** are paid **automatically** from your account credit.
- **Existing invoices** must be paid **manually** by applying credit.

### How to Apply Credit to an Invoice

1. Log in to the **Client Portal**
2. Go to **Billing → My Invoices**
3. Open the invoice you want to pay
4. On the invoice, locate the green **Apply Credit** section
5. Enter the amount you want to apply (or the full invoice amount)
6. Click **Apply Credit**
