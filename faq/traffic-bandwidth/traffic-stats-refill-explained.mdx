## All about VPS Traffic, Metering and Refills

This document explains how to access and interpret traffic information for a VPS through the management portal. It includes details on total traffic used, available (remaining) traffic, and monthly reset/refills, as well as a chart showing cumulative traffic and days remaining until the next refill. Users can also view daily traffic data for every VPS.

### Total traffic used

The total amount of traffic (GB and percentage) consumed since the beginning of the current **monthly** service timeframe.

### Total traffic available

The total amount of traffic included in your plan for a 1-month period.

### Monthly Traffic Reset/Refill&#x20;

Days remaining for monthly VPS traffic reset. Countdown to when your VPS traffic metrics will be reset and the traffic allocation for your plan is replenished (refill).

### How we Meter Traffic&#x20;

EDIS Global monitors traffic counters on  the ethernet interfaces of your virtual private servers in real-time. The total traffic usage is determined by summing-up the ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic.

$$Total Traffic  =  \sum (\text{IN} + \text{OUT})$$

### What happens when all traffic is consumed?

Warnings are being sent out at 80%, 90%, and at 100% traffic usage levels.&#x20;
When all traffic is used, your ethernet interface is throttled to about 64kbit/s.&#x20;
We apply a **5% grace** amount, so the throttling only happens at roughly 105% usage.
There's no overage charge, ensuring your server remains online even if all traffic has been used. There are several options for [restoration](https://docs.edisglobal.com/traffic-pool-global-and-premium-traffic-zone) when traffic has been used in full.&#x20;

### Exponential Traffic Chart

We have a chart showing the **total (cumulated) traffic** since the last refill. VPS traffic meters are reset and refilled monthly, on your product's key (renewal) date.

There is a small indicator (red arrow below) showing how many days to go until your VPS receive its next monthly traffic refill.&#x20;

This indicator is helpful to understand, iif you should "hydrate" your KVM withÂ traffic from your <a href="https://docs.edisglobal.com/traffic-pool-global-and-premium-traffic-zone" target="_blank">traffic pool</a>,  upgrade to a higher tier, or if you want to sit it out.

The red line represents the total amount of traffic available to your KVM. It usually shows the amount of traffic included in your plan. The line moves higher when you add  traffic from the traffic pool.&#x20;
