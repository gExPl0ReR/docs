# Detecting Suspicious Network Spikes in Linux Servers 🚨

Unusual network spikes often come from background activity you don’t expect — hidden tasks or processes quietly using your bandwidth, such as:

- **Rogue scripts:** hidden or leftover commands constantly transferring data.  
- **Crypto miners:** unauthorized software using your server’s CPU and network for mining.  
- **Misbehaving processes:** normal services stuck in loops or retries, flooding the network.

Spotting these early helps you prevent wasted data, slow performance, and unexpected network costs.

## 1) Monitor Live Network Activity

Start by checking which IPs or processes are using your network. Two lightweight tools are `iftop` and `nload`.

Before running them, make sure you’re using the correct network interface —  
it’s not always `eth0` (it can be `ens3`, `ens18`, `eno1`, etc.).  
You can find your active interface by running:

~~~bash
ip -o link show up | awk -F': ' '{print $2}'
~~~

Then replace `eth0` in the commands below with your interface name:

~~~bash
sudo apt install iftop nload -y
sudo iftop -i eth0
~~~

In **iftop**, you’ll see source/destination IPs, ports, and data rates.  
Look for unknown or suspicious external IPs constantly sending or receiving data.

If you want a simpler graph view:

~~~bash
sudo nload eth0
~~~

## 2) Identify Which Process Is Behind the Network Usage

Once you spot unusual network activity, use `ss` (modern) or `netstat` (optional) to find the process behind the connections.

~~~bash
# recommended (modern tool)
sudo ss -tupn
~~~

If you prefer `netstat`, install `net-tools` first:

~~~bash
sudo apt install net-tools -y
sudo netstat -tupn
~~~

Based on the screenshot below, you can see how each process (identified by its **PID**) connects to remote hosts.  
For example, a process like `xray-linux-amd6` with PID `28799` is making outbound connections to multiple external IPs — a strong sign of a background service or script consuming network bandwidth.

![ss and netstat example screenshot](/assets/tunpn-tests.png)
💡 *`ss` / `netstat` output shows which PIDs are opening remote connections and potentially causing abnormal network usage.*

---

## 3) Inspect the Suspicious Process

Now that you’ve identified the suspicious PID from **`ss`** or **`netstat`**, check what it actually is and where it’s running from.

~~~bash
ps aux | grep 28799
ls -l /proc/28799/exe
strings /proc/28799/cmdline
~~~

💡 *Replace **`28799`** with the PID of the process you found suspicious in the previous step.*

If you notice the executable path pointing to directories like **`/tmp/`**, **`/dev/shm/`**, or **`/var/tmp/`**,  
it’s often a rogue or crypto-mining script — legitimate system services rarely run from those paths.

|:--:|:--:|
|Check process binary path.|Check full cmdline for execution arguments.|

---

## 4) Kill and Quarantine the Script

Stop the suspicious process immediately (replace **28799** with your PID):

~~~bash
sudo kill -9 28799
~~~

Before deleting, back up the executable for later analysis:

~~~bash
sudo cp /proc/28799/exe /root/suspicious_exe_backup || true
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/x-ui/bin/xray-linux-amd64 /tmp/.miner /var/tmp/.hidden || true
~~~

|:--:|:--:|
|Network usage before stopping process.|Network usage after stopping — activity drops.|

---

## 5) Check Cron Jobs and Autostart Entries

Many rogue scripts try to restart automatically after reboot using cron or startup files.  
Inspect the following locations carefully:

~~~bash
crontab -l
sudo cat /etc/crontab
sudo ls /etc/cron.d/
sudo cat /etc/rc.local
~~~

Also check these common paths:

~~~text
/etc/systemd/system/
/etc/init.d/
/home/*/.bashrc
/home/*/.profile
~~~

If you find a suspicious entry like this:

~~~bash
@reboot sleep 30 && /usr/local/x-ui/bin/xray-linux-amd64 -c /usr/local/x-ui/config.json >/dev/null 2>&1 &
~~~

or something referencing temporary paths:

~~~bash
@reboot /tmp/.miner/start.sh
~~~

remove it immediately, as it will automatically restart the rogue process every time the system boots.

💡 *Tip:* Legitimate cron jobs usually run system maintenance tasks (like backups or log rotations) — anything starting from `/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, or `/var/tmp` is highly suspicious.

---

## 6) Use nethogs for Per-Process Network Tracking

To continuously monitor which processes use the most network bandwidth:

~~~bash
sudo apt install nethogs -y
sudo nethogs
~~~

You’ll see a live list of processes with **sent** and **received** rates — perfect for spotting anomalies before they grow.

## 7) Check Your Overall Network Usage

If you suspect something has already used too much data, you can review your usage stats directly in your EDIS dashboard.  
It shows **total monthly usage**, **daily graphs**, and **refill times**.

📘 [Learn how EDIS Global measures network usage and refill cycles here](https://docs.edisglobal.com/faq/traffic-bandwidth/traffic-stats-refill-explained).

## 8) Harden the System Against Rogue Scripts 🛡️

After removing the rogue process, secure your server to prevent it from coming back.

- **If `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` are separate mounts, disable script execution:**
  ~~~bash
  sudo mount -o remount,noexec /tmp
  sudo mount -o remount,noexec /var/tmp || true
  ~~~

- **If you get “mount point not mounted” error:**  
  it means `/tmp` isn’t a separate mount. Use this safer alternative:
  ~~~bash
  sudo mount -o bind /tmp /tmp
  sudo mount -o remount,noexec,nosuid /tmp
  ~~~

- **Limit outbound connections:**  
  Use `ufw` or `iptables` to block unknown processes from sending data.

- **Find recently changed files (possible rogue scripts):**
  ~~~bash
  sudo find / -mtime -1 -type f 2>/dev/null
  ~~~

- **Check SSH login attempts:**
  ~~~bash
  sudo journalctl -u ssh | grep "Failed password"
  ~~~

💡 *Tip:* You can also follow our detailed [SSH Security Hardening Guide](https://docs.edisglobal.com/getting-started/ssh-security-hardening-guide)  
for advanced protection steps such as disabling root login, changing default SSH ports, and setting up fail2ban.
