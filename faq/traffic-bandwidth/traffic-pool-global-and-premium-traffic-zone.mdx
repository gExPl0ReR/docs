Traffic Pool

Running out of traffic can be a hassle. At EDIS Global, our traffic pool feature allows you to easily ‘hydrate’ your VPS with additional traffic as needed. With just a few clicks, allocate traffic from your pool and keep your server online without interruptions.

To make it easy for you, we created two traffic zones rather than having a variety of different traffic-prices for our almost 50 locations.

✅ Manually assign traffic to any KVM in your account which is running low on traffic.

✅ Automatic refill option individually configurable for every VPS ("Auto Hydration")

### 

### 🌐 Global Traffic Zone

Standard traffic at base cost, available in most regions.

### 💎 Premium Traffic Zone

High-demand regions with increased traffic costs (e.g., Cyprus, UAE, Australia, Chile, Colombia).

## **How to Get Started with the EDIS Traffic Pool**

### 🛒 Purchase Traffic

Choose the amount of traffic you need and Top Up your Traffic Pool.

### 📌 Assign Traffic

Once payment is complete, go to the Traffic Information window in your server’s management page to assign traffic to your service. Use +100GB, +500GB, +1TB, +10TB buttons for manual hydration.

### 🎁 Traffic Pool Starter Credit

Every new VPS includes **100 GB of Traffic Pool Starter Credit**. 
This credit **never expires**, can be applied to **any VPS in your account**, and can be used **manually** when a server runs out of traffic — or can be used automatically through **Auto Hydration**.

### ⚙️ Enable Auto-Hydration

Enable Auto-Hydration for automatic traffic assignment to your VPS when usage hits 99%.

### 💡 Quick Tip: Traffic Usage Multipliers

🌐 Global Traffic Zone: 1TB pool traffic gives you 1TB traffic

💎 Premium Traffic Zone: 1TB pool traffic gives you 0.5TB traffic

## Traffic Pool in the Traffic Information Window

In the Traffic Information window, you can monitor and manage your traffic pool allocation. This section provides a snapshot of your current traffic usage and remaining balance, with options for manual or automatic top-ups to ensure uninterrupted service.

### Infographic Key

**A. Traffic Pool Size & Top-Up Link:** Shows your current pool balance, with a “top up” option to add traffic when needed.

**B. Manual Hydration:** Manually allocate +100GB, +500GB, or +1TB to your VPS as required.

**C. Auto Hydration:**

**Automatically top up your traffic pool with 100GB, 200GB, 300GB, or 500GB** when usage reaches 99%, ensuring uninterrupted service. Auto top-up can be enabled or disabled at any time. You can configure the top-up size individually for each VPS through the management portal or API.

**For custom monitoring,** use our **\_callback feature**\_ via the Management REST API

<CtaButton label="Callback via API" link="https://docs.edisglobal.com/management-api-reference/hooks/example-callback-triggered" />

to trigger notifications when traffic reaches a defined threshold.

## Traffic Accounting Balance Sheet

The balance sheet below (demo data) works like a bank account statement. We log **traffic top-ups**, **pool** **traffic consumption**, and the resulting balance after each transaction. This report provides a transparent overview of **pool** **traffic usage across your entire VPS hosting account**.

**How to Read the Balance Sheet**

• **Date/Time:** Timestamp of the transaction.\
• **Source:** The VPS instance consuming traffic, or a Traffic Pool Top-Up\
• **Change:** Shows the amount of traffic deducted (negative) or added (positive).\
• **New Balance:** The updated traffic balance after the transaction.

| Date/Time           | Source                                                 | Change         | New Balance |

**:envelope: ​We will notify you by email when 80% of your total traffic pool balance has been used.**

<CtaButton label="Top-up Traffic Pool" link="https://manage.edisglobal.com/cart.php?gid=214" />

### **Email Notification at 20% Remaining**

We’ve implemented an automatic email notification to help you stay ahead of traffic exhaustion. After each top-up, your traffic pool is considered 100% full.

Once **80% of that traffic has been assigned**, you will receive an email letting you know that **only 20% remains**. This early alert gives you time to top up your pool and avoid service interruptions.
