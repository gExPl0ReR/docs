Traffic Pool

Running out of traffic can be a hassle. At EDIS Global, our traffic pool feature allows you to easily ‚Äòhydrate‚Äô your VPS with additional traffic as needed. With just a few clicks, allocate traffic from your pool and keep your server online without interruptions.

To make it easy for you, we created two traffic zones rather than having a variety of different traffic-prices for our almost 50 locations.

### *Why You'll Love Your Traffic Pool*

‚úÖ Maintain optimal functioning for your services.

‚úÖ Take advantage of lowest price traffic rates (starting from EUR 6 /TB)

‚úÖ Traffic in the pool never expires.

‚úÖ Manually assign traffic to any KVM in your account which is running low on traffic.

‚úÖ Automatic refill option individually configurable for every VPS ("Auto Hydration")

## Traffic Accounting Balance Sheet

The balance sheet below (demo data) works like a bank account statement. We log **traffic top-ups**, **pool** **traffic consumption**, and the resulting balance after each transaction. This report provides a transparent overview of **pool** **traffic usage across your entire VPS hosting account**.

**How to Read the Balance Sheet**

‚Ä¢ **Date/Time:** Timestamp of the transaction.\
‚Ä¢ **Source:** The VPS instance consuming traffic, or a Traffic Pool Top-Up\
‚Ä¢ **Change:** Shows the amount of traffic deducted (negative) or added (positive).\
‚Ä¢ **New Balance:** The updated traffic balance after the transaction.
