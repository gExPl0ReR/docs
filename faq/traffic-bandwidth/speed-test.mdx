# Running a Speed Test on Linux and Windows (10Gbps-Aware)

A quick guide to running reliable speed tests on Linux and Windows, especially for 10Gbps setups.

---

## 🐧 Speed Test on Linux

We recommend using the **Speedtest CLI** by Ookla for reliable results.

### 🔧 Installation

Run the following commands to install:

```bash
# Add Ookla's repository
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/ookla/speedtest-cli/script.deb.sh | sudo bash

# Install the speedtest tool
sudo apt install speedtest
```

### 🚀 Running a Basic Speed Test

Once installed, run a simple speed test:

```bash
speedtest
```

⚠️However, the default server might **not support 10Gbps** speeds, resulting in underwhelming results.

**To get accurate high-speed measurements**:


### 📋 List Available Servers

```bash
speedtest -L
```

This will output a list of servers with their IDs.

### 🎯 Run Test on a Specific Server

Pick a server that supports high throughput (based on location and provider) and use its ID:

```bash
speedtest -s <server-id>
```

Example:

```bash
speedtest -s 12345
```

## 🪟 Speed Test on Windows

While the command line option is also available, for most users we recommend using the **Speedtest app** by Ookla.

### ⬇️ Download the App

Download the official Speedtest app from Ookla's website:

* [Download Speedtest for Windows](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/windows)

This GUI-based tool provides more stable and optimized results, especially on systems with higher bandwidth.

### ⚠️ Notes on 10Gbps Testing

Just like on Linux, **not all servers support 10Gbps**. If you're seeing low results:

1. Click on the **current server name** displayed under the speed dial.

2. From the list that appears, select another server — preferably one known to support higher bandwidth.

3. Try multiple nearby servers to find the best performance.
