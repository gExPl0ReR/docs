## Why KVM Virtual Private Servers are superior

**KVM** are virtual machines based on the KVM hypervisor and provide full hardware virtualization (sometimes called "bare metal virtualization"). Almost every operating system that runs on x86 or AMD64 hardware (Linux distributions, FreeBSD, Microsoft Windows Server, ‚Ä¶) can be run inside an EDIS Global KVM.

### Key features that differentiate EDIS Global KVM from a standard VPS:

- TUN/TAP device is available (required for VPN)
- HostCPU passthrough is available (provides hardware functions of Intel processors, e.g. AES-NI for encryption ‚Äî important for VPN throughput with low CPU impact)
- Runs all kinds of networking services
- Runs all kinds of admin panels like cPanel, DirectAdmin, Odin Plesk panel, and many more
- Additional virtual NICs can be added
- VLAN tagging within a particular location can be activated
- KVM can be compared to a dedicated server, with all the benefits of a virtual machine
- Operating systems can be installed at the touch of a button via one-click installation
- Manually install or debug inside a noVNC session (comparable to a remote desktop)
- Bring your own .ISO and boot up a bare-metal backup of any server inside an EDIS KVM

## Unexpected use cases for a KVM VPS

Beyond hosting websites and running admin panels, a KVM VPS opens the door to some surprising projects:

- üåç **Geo-distributed VPN nodes** ‚Üí spin up exit nodes in dozens of countries to test geo-blocked services, monitor latency, or build private multi-region VPN networks
- üîê **Encrypted data vaults** ‚Üí run your own end-to-end encrypted backup service, completely isolated from third-party storage providers
- üì° **Ad & tracker sinkhole** ‚Üí deploy Pi-hole or custom DNS filtering to block advertising and trackers for your entire team
- ü§ñ **Automation hubs** ‚Üí control IoT devices, cron-based workflows, or even manage smart home dashboards from anywhere in the world
- üéô **Internet radio or podcast relay** ‚Üí broadcast live audio or rebroadcast streams through Icecast/Shoutcast for small-scale media projects
- üß™ **Security sandbox** ‚Üí safely detonate malware samples, test exploits, or run penetration-testing labs with real networking features (thanks to TUN/TAP and HostCPU passthrough)
- üìà **Data collection node** ‚Üí scrape public data, run uptime monitoring, or capture BGP/DNS telemetry from different regions
- üé® **Creative computing** ‚Üí train small AI models, render art with tools like Stable Diffusion, or host collaborative creative coding environments (Jupyter, Processing, ‚Ä¶)
- üìö **Learning lab** ‚Üí simulate complex multi-OS networks for certifications (RHCE, CCNA, ‚Ä¶) or for teaching computer science remotely
