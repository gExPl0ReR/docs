## Why KVM Virtual Private Servers are superior

**KVM**Â are virtual machines based on the so-called KVM hypervisor and provide full hardware virtualization (sometimes called "bare metal virtualization"). Almost every operating system that runs on x86 or AMD64 hardware (Linux distributions, FreeBSD, Microsoft Windows Server, ...) can be run inside an EDIS Global KVM.

What are the main features that differentiate EDIS KVM from a standard VPS:

- TUN/TAP device is available (required for VPN)
- HostCPU passthrough is available (provides hardware functions of Intel processors, e.g. AES-NI for encryption. Important when using VPN: high throughput, low CPU impact).
- Runs all kinds of networking services
- Runs all kinds of admin panels like cPanel, DirectAdmin, Odin Plesk panel, and many more.
- Additional virtual NICs can be added
- VLAN tagging within a particular location can be activated
- KVM can be compared to a dedicated server, with all the benefits of a virtual machine
- Operating systems can be installed at the touch of a button - through one-click-installation
- Manually install or debug inside a noVNC session (comparable to a remote desktop)
- Bring your own .ISO and boot up a bare-metal backup of any server inside an EDIS KVM
