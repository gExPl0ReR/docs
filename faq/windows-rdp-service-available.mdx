## Does EDIS Global offer Windows RDP Service?

EDIS Global offers 1-click fully automated installations for the following operating systems directly through the KVM panel. &#x20;

- Windows 2016 Server
- Windows 2019 Server
- Windows 2022 Server
- Windows 10

After the installation is completed (we install from scratch, so it might take 15 minutes to finish a Windows Server installation), you'll be delivered with a fully working Windows installation and you can connect to it using RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol).

We use the **Standard Windows RDP port**, which is 3389.

<Note>
  EDIS does not provide a Windows license. You have 180 days to enter your own
  license key and activate the Windows trial installations.
