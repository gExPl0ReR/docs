After the installation is completed (we install from scratch, so **it only takes about 15 minutes** to finish a Windows Server setup), you'll receive a fully working Windows environment.  
You can connect immediately using RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, Windows App, or any other RDP-compatible client).

We use the **standard Windows RDP port**, which is **3389**.

### Windows RDP Trial and Licensing

<Note>
  EDIS does not provide a Windows license. You have 180 days to enter your own
  license key and activate the trial installation.
