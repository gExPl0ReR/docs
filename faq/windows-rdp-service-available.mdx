After the installation is completed (we install from scratch, so **it will take 15 minutes to finish** a Windows Server installation), you'll be delivered with a fully working Windows installation, and you can connect to your Windows machine using RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, Windows App or any other Microsoft RDP compatible application).

We use **Standard Windows RDP port**, which is 3389.

<Note>
  EDIS does not provide a Windows license. You have 180 days to enter your own license key and activate the Windows trial installations.
