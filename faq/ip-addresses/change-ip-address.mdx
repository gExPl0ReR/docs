## **How to Change Your IP Address**

### **Free IP Change (Within the First 24 Hours)**

If you purchased a VPS, you’re eligible for one free IP change within the first 24 hours.

### **Steps to Change Your IP Address:**

1. **Log into your EDIS Global** <a href="https://manage.edisglobal.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">**dashboard**</a> using your credentials.
2. **Locate your VPS** in the Services tab
3. **Initiate the IP Change** by clicking on the ♻️ recycle icon next to your current IP.

**Note:** After the IP change, you will need to reinstall your system or manually configure the new IP in your OS using VNC. Once a new IP is assigned, your old IP will stop working immediately.

## Configure New IP After a Change

**Steps to Configure IP After Change:**

• **Reinstall your VPS** for the new IP to become active.

• **Manually configure** your new IP using VNC if you prefer not to reinstall.

## **IP Changes After 24 Hours**

### **After 24 Hours:**

• Changing IP addresses incurs a fee:

• Standard IP Change: €5 (random IP assigned)

• Bespoke IP Change: €10 (choose from available IPs)

### Standard IP Change

With a standard IP change, the system automatically assigns a random IP address.

### Bespoke IP Change

For a bespoke IP change, you will be provided with a list of IP addresses from various prefixes. You can select the IP address you prefer from this list.

### Request an IP Address Change

To request either a Standard- or a Bespoke IP Change, please get in touch through the messenger. We need your KVM_ID and the IP address you'd like to change, as well as the service you are requesting (Standard (random) IP Change, or Bespoke IP Change)
