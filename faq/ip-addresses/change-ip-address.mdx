## How to Change Your IP Address

### Free IP Change (Within 24 Hours)

You’re eligible for one **free IP change** if requested within the first 24 hours of your VPS purchase.

**Steps:**

1. Log in to your EDIS Global [dashboard](https://manage.edisglobal.com/clientarea.php).
2. Navigate to **Services** and locate your VPS.
3. Click the ♻️ recycle icon next to your current IP to request the change.

> **Note:** After the IP change, you will need to **reinstall your system or manually configure** the new IP using VNC. Once the new IP is activated, your old IP stops working immediately.

## IP Change After 24 Hours (Paid Options)

If more than 24 hours have passed, IP changes incur a fee. You have two options:

| Option | Price | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard IP Change** | **€5** | A new IP is automatically assigned (random subnet; no selection). |
| **Bespoke IP Change** | **€10** | You choose an IP from a provided list of available addresses. |

### Standard IP Change

After payment, the system assigns a random IP from a /24 subnet. You cannot influence the subnet selection.
> **Note:** “Random” means you cannot pick the subnet or guarantee its prefix.

### Bespoke IP Change

You will receive a list of available IPs (from varying prefixes) and can choose one.
> **Note:** If you previously had an IP and it’s still unassigned, you may see it in this list.

## Configure New IP After Change (for ALL cases)

> **Important:** Once the new IP is assigned, the **old IP immediately stops working**. You must activate the new IP by either:
>
> • **Reinstalling your VPS**, or
> • **Manually configuring** it using VNC

<CtaButton label="(Re-) Install Linux/Windows" link="../../vps-management/autoinstall-reinstall-install-vps-linux-windows" />
<CtaButton label="Enable VNC server" link="../../vps-management/enable-vnc-server" />

## Summary & Recommendations

- If within 24 hours → use the **free IP change**.
- After 24 hours → choose **Standard** or **Bespoke**.
- **Always** follow up by reinstalling or configuring your new IP (see above).
