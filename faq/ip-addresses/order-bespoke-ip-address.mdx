## Ordering a Bespoke IPv4 Address

If you are interested to order bespoke IP addresses

* Reach out to us via messenger
* Provide the **primary IP address** or **KVM_ID** of your VPS
* Indicate the **number of additional bespoke IP addresses** you'd like to order



**We'll take care of the ordering process and send you an invoice.**
You'll be provided with a list of IP addresses in multiple prefixes available in the server location where your VPS is hosted.

Once the payment has gone through, our team will provision the IPv4 address you picked. 
After provisioning, all IP addresses will be displayed in the management portal. 

You need to manually configure additional IP addresses in your operating system.
