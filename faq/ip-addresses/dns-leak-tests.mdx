# 🔍 Understanding DNS Leak Tests and Anycast DNS on EDIS Global VPS

When running DNS leak tests like **dnsleaktest.com** or **whoer.net**, you may sometimes notice that detected DNS servers are **not located in the same country as your VPS**.

### 🛡️ Why is this happening?

At **EDIS Global**, we use **fast and secure Anycast DNS servers** provided by **Cloudflare**—specifically **1.1.1.1** and **1.0.0.1**—to handle DNS resolution on our VPS.  

With **Anycast technology**, your DNS requests are routed to the **closest and fastest available server**. This means your DNS traffic might be handled by a server **outside your VPS location**, even in a neighboring country.  

> ⚠️ **This is completely normal and nothing to worry about.**

#### ✅ Does this affect my VPS geo-location?
**No!**  
The DNS server location **does not influence** the geographic location of your VPS.  
Your **VPS IP address** is what defines your geo-location, and not where DNS queries are resolved.

#### 🔄 Why do test results show different locations?
DNS leak tests show the **location of the DNS resolvers** that handled your queries (such as Cloudflare's Anycast nodes), which may differ from your VPS's actual location. Sometimes the nearest and fastest DNS server may even be across a national border.

## ✅ What is a DNS Leak Test?

A **DNS Leak Test** checks whether your DNS requests are securely handled or if they accidentally leak outside your protected network, such as:
- To your **local internet provider (ISP)**.
- Outside of your **VPN tunnel**.

The purpose of the test is to **confirm that only the intended DNS servers are used**, ensuring your privacy.

---

## 🧪 How does a DNS Leak Test work?

DNS leak tests, like **dnsleaktest.com** and **whoer.net**, ask your device to resolve a series of unique domain names. The test then observes:
- **Which DNS servers** answered the queries.
- Their **IP addresses**.
- Their **geographic locations**.
- The **organizations** operating them.

---

## 🔍 What is the difference between Standard and Extended Tests?

### Standard Test:
- Performs a **quick check**.
- Detects obvious DNS leaks.
- Recommended for most users.

### Extended Test:
- Runs a **more thorough scan**.
- Identifies all potential DNS servers.
- Useful for higher privacy needs, but usually not necessary.

## ⚙️ Can I change the DNS servers on my VPS?

Yes!  
If you want to influence the test results or use different DNS resolvers, you can:
- Switch to **Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)**, **Quad9 (9.9.9.9)**, **OpenDNS (208.67.222.222)**, or others.
- Configure your own **custom DNS servers** on your VPS.

#### 🔑 But remember:
> **The goal of DNS leak tests is to detect if DNS requests are leaking outside your secure environment (like a VPN or VPS), not to determine geo-location accuracy.**

---

## 📝 Summary
- **EDIS Global** uses **Cloudflare Anycast DNS (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1)** to ensure **fast, secure DNS resolution**.
- DNS leak test results showing locations different from your VPS location are **expected**.
- **DNS server location does NOT affect your VPS's IP geo-location**.
- You can change DNS resolvers if you want to adjust test results.
- The purpose of a DNS Leak Test is **privacy and security**, ensuring DNS requests do not escape your secure environment.
