Customers often report packet loss after running traceroute or MTR tests and seeing **80% or even 100% loss on intermediate hops**. In many cases, however, the **final destination shows no packet loss at all**.

This article explains how to correctly interpret these results and how to distinguish between real connectivity problems and harmless artifacts of how routers handle diagnostic traffic.

---

## Quick summary

- Packet loss on **intermediate hops** does **not automatically mean a problem**
- The **final hop** (your VPS or target host) is what matters most
- Many routers **de-prioritize or rate-limit ICMP responses**
- Virtualized environments add additional layers where ICMP handling may differ from normal traffic

If the final destination shows **0% packet loss and stable latency**, your connection is usually healthy.

## How packet loss measurements actually work

Tools like **traceroute** and **MTR** send diagnostic packets (usually ICMP or UDP) and measure how routers respond.

Important: routers are optimized to **forward traffic**, not to respond to diagnostic probes. When under load, they may:

- Rate-limit ICMP replies
- Drop diagnostic packets
- Respond inconsistently

This can appear as packet loss in MTR even when real user traffic flows normally.

## How to run proper tests

Before interpreting packet loss, make sure the test was run correctly.

### Using traceroute and MTR

Follow our step-by-step guide:

👉 https://docs.edisglobal.com/faq/ip-addresses/debugging-packet-loss-traceroute-mtr-windows

Run MTR for at least **100 cycles** to get meaningful statistics.

### Using ping.pe

For external verification from multiple locations:

👉 https://docs.edisglobal.com/documentation/faq/ip-addresses/ping-pe-connectivity-check

This helps confirm whether an issue is local or global.

## How to interpret MTR output

### Scenario 1: Loss on intermediate hops only

Example:

```
Hop 1   80% loss
Hop 2   100% loss
Hop 3   0% loss
Final   0% loss
```

This usually means:

- Intermediate routers are rate-limiting ICMP
- Traffic forwarding is unaffected
- There is **no real packet loss** to the destination

If the final hop shows **0% loss**, the connection is working.

---

### Scenario 2: Loss continues to the final hop

Example:

```
Hop 1   0% loss
[..]
Hop 3   10% loss
Hop 4   10% loss
Final   10% loss
```

This indicates **real packet loss**, because it propagates to the destination.

Possible causes:

- Network congestion
- Faulty links
- Host or hypervisor issues

This is when investigation is required.

---

### Scenario 3: High latency spikes without final loss

Occasional latency spikes on intermediate hops are common and often harmless if:

- The final hop latency is stable
- There is no packet loss at the destination

Routers may prioritize forwarding over responding to probes.

---

## Packet loss in virtualized environments

In virtualized environments, network traffic passes through:

- Guest virtual interfaces
- Hypervisor networking layers
- Host networking stacks

These layers may treat diagnostic ICMP differently from normal traffic. As a result:

- Intermediate packet loss may appear exaggerated
- Real application traffic may remain unaffected

Always judge connectivity based on the **final hop and application behavior**, not intermediate ICMP statistics alone.

---

## When to contact support

Please contact our support team if you observe:

- Packet loss on the **final hop**
- Persistent high latency to the destination
- Application-level connectivity issues

When reporting issues, include:

- Full MTR output 
- Test timestamps (UTC)
- Source and destination IP addresses
- ping.pe results if available

This helps us diagnose problems quickly.

## Final takeaway

MTR is a powerful tool, but it is often misunderstood.

👉 **Packet loss on intermediate hops alone is not a reliable indicator of network problems.**\
👉 The final destination’s statistics are what truly matter.

If the destination shows stable latency and no loss, your connection is healthy — even if earlier hops look alarming.
