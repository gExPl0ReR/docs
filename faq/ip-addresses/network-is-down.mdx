title: Network Is Down (Linux server)
description: Sometimes it feels like your server is unreachable or the network is not working. In these cases, the best first step is to connect directly to the server using **VNC** and check its status.

## How to Connect to the Server via VNC

1. Log in to the [KVM Management Portal](https://manage.edisglobal.com/clientarea.php).
2. Locate your VPS in the Services tab.
3. Click on **Start VNC** , then use **noVNC** to connect to the console of your server.

## What to Check Once Connected via VNC

If your server's operating system is **Linux**:

1. **Check the network interfaces:**

   ```bash
   ip a
   ```

   - Make sure the network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `ens3`) is UP and has a valid IP address.

2. **Check the gateway and ping it:**

   ```bash
   ip route
   ```

   - Identify the gateway address (look for the line `default via ...`).
   - Then ping the gateway:

     ```bash
     ping -c 4 <IP_GATEWAY>
     ```

3. **Ping local addresses:**

   - Ensure the local network stack is working:

     ```bash
     ping -c 4 127.0.0.1
     ping -c 4 $(hostname -I)
     ```

4. **Check the SSH service:**

   - Verify if the SSH service is running:

     ```bash
     systemctl status sshd
     ```

5. **Check the web server (if applicable):**

   - If nginx or apache is installed:

     ```bash
     systemctl status nginx
     # or
     systemctl status apache2
     ```

6. **Review recent logs:**

   - Check for any recent system or network errors:

     ```bash
     journalctl -xe
     ```

7. **Restart the networking service if necessary:**

   - If there are issues with the network interfaces or configuration:

     ```bash
     systemctl restart networking
     ```
