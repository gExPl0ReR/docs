## Traceroute and MTR on Windows

If you're experiencing packet loss or a slow connection between your home internet and your VPS, we would appreciate if you could provide us with an MTR or TRACEROUTE report. This will give us a detailed view of the network path between your home connection and your VPS, highlighting where the packet loss might be occurring.

**For Windows Users**:
Windows does not come with MTR by default, but you can run a TRACEROUTE easily.

1. **TRACEROUTE**:
   - Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.
   - In the Command Prompt window, type: `tracert [Your VPS IP Address]`
   - Wait for it to complete. This can take a few minutes.
   - Once complete, right-click inside the Command Prompt window, select `Mark`, then highlight the entire result, and press `Enter` to copy.
   - Paste the results in your reply to us.
2. **MTR**:
   - If you specifically want an MTR report, you would need a third-party tool like WinMTR.
   - Download WinMTR from <a href="https://winmtr.net" target="_blank">here</a>.
   - Install and open WinMTR.
   - In the "Host" box, type your VPS IP address.
   - Click "Start" and let it run for at least 5-10 minutes to gather sufficient data.
   - After it's done, click on "Export TEXT" and save the report.
   - Attach the saved report in your reply to us.

Please share the results with us, and we'll promptly investigate where the issue might lie and work towards a resolution.
