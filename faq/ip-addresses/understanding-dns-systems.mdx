# 🌐 Understanding the Different DNS Systems at EDIS Global

At **EDIS Global**, we operate different DNS systems for different purposes to give you maximum speed, security, and resilience. Here's an overview of how DNS is handled within our infrastructure.


## 🔄 Reverse DNS (rDNS) Resolution — **EDIS Global Anycast DNS**

When someone performs a **reverse DNS lookup** (trying to find the domain name behind your IP address), EDIS Global handles these queries through our **own global Anycast DNS network**:

- ns1.edis.global  
- ns2.edis.global  

### Why use Anycast for rDNS?

You might wonder:  
> "*Isn't that overkill for reverse DNS?*" 😉
