### Why Do IP Location Discrepancies Happen?

IP geolocation relies on third-party databases that interpret IP addresses’ physical locations. Sites like *WhatIsMyIPAddress.com* pull data from sources like IP2Location. Discrepancies can arise when outdated databases are being used.

### How IP Geolocation is Maintained

IP address geolocation is managed primarily by regional network organizations. These databases are updated regularly, but third-party services sometimes lag, especially when using free or older databases. As a result, IPs may show locations that are outdated or incorrect.

### Common Reasons for Incorrect Geolocation

1. **Old Database Records**: Some providers update their data less frequently, leading to outdated location information.

2. **Mixed Data Sources**: Aggregated data from multiple providers can sometimes mix locations.

3. **User Input**: Certain providers allow users to submit location changes, which can introduce inaccuracies.

4. **Commercial Interest**: GeoIP database providers often limit free access to older data to encourage subscription purchases, affecting location accuracy on free lookup sites.

### Steps to Take if Your IP Shows Incorrectly

If your IP location appears incorrect:

1. **Verify with Multiple Sources**: Try geolocation meta-sites like [IPLocation.net](https://www.iplocation.net), which uses multiple databases, to check if the issue is specific to one provider only.

2. **Reach Out to EDIS**: If you’re a client, we can confirm that your IP is correctly registered in major databases and provide guidance.&#x20;

### Conclusion

While EDIS maintains accurate geolocation data with several trusted providers, discrepancies can still appear on sites that use outdated information. Rest assured, your VPS location is correct as registered.
