## Does EDIS announce my IP ranges?

Yes and no. It depends.

EDIS does not announce third-party IP prefixes for use with its VPS services.

You can bring your own prefixes and use them with our dedicated servers.
An USD 250 one-off (NRC) fee for the BGP announcement applies. There are no monthly fees for maintaining a BGP announcement.

<Warning>
  Kindly bear in mind that EDIS does not support the distribution of unsolicited
