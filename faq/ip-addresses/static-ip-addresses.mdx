## Are VPS IP Addresses Static or Dynamic?

<Note>
  Both the **IPv4 address and the IPv6 /64 prefix** assigned to your VPS **are
  "static".**
</Note>

This means that they will not change for as long as you have the virtual server.

The IP addresses also remain unchanged in case you need to reinstall your KVM virtual server, no matter how long the reinstall will take you.

**Bottomline:** An IP address assigned to your VPS remains yours till you cancel your server.
