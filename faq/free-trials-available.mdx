## Does EDIS Global offer free VPS trials?

No. EDIS Global does not offer free VPS hosting trials.

However, you can sign up for any regular VPS plan and use our **24-hour refund policy** if the service is not what you expected. That way, you can still try our platform risk-free.

## FAQ: Free Trials

**Why no free VPS trial?**\
