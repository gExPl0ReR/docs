## Does EDIS Global provide hourly VPS plans?

EDIS does not provide "hourly VPS".

Since our <a href="https://www.edisglobal.com/vps-server/austria-vienna" target="_blank">entry level plans</a> sell from only EUR 4.99 /month (EUR 0.0068 per 1 hour) in most of our 48 global locations, billing by the hour would not be financially feasible as 4 days of service would equate to roughly EUR 0.68, which exceeds the fee charged by payment providers for processing the transaction.&#x20;
