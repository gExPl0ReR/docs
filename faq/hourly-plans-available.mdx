## Does EDIS Global provide hourly VPS plans?

No, EDIS Global does not provide hourly VPS hosting.  

Our <a href="https://www.edisglobal.com/vps-hosting/austria-vienna" target="_blank">entry-level KVM VPS plan</a> starts at only **€4.99 per month** (≈ €0.0068 per hour) in most of our 50+ global locations.  

Offering true hourly billing is not financially feasible:  
- Just **4 days of service costs ~€0.68**,  
- which is already higher than the **payment processing fees** charged by providers for each transaction.  

Because of this, we offer **monthly billing only**, ensuring transparent pricing and reliable service worldwide.

### Why no hourly VPS?

- Transaction fees exceed the value of micro-payments.  
- Monthly billing keeps plans affordable and predictable.  
- With €4.99/month pricing, you still get near “hourly” cost efficiency.

### Alternative: Short-Term VPS

If you need a VPS only for a short period, you can cancel by the end of the month.  
This way, you still benefit from **enterprise-grade VPS hosting** at a price close to hourly hosting elsewhere.
