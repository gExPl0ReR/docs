## **How to Connect to a Remote System on Windows and Mac**

This guide offers a clear procedure to connect to a Windows server via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). While the focus is on Windows, Mac users will find steps tailored for them, too. Please make sure you have Windows installed on your VPS. If you ordered a VPS with Linux installed, you can [reinstall the OS](https://docs.edisglobal.com/autoinstall-reinstall-install-vps-linux-windows) at any time with Windows.&#x20;
