## **Support Boundaries to Keep Your Data Secure** **🔒**

To protect your privacy and maintain strict security standards, our support team operates exclusively at the infrastructure level. 

The means we **do not:**

* Log in to your servers

* Install or configure software

* Change system settings, passwords, or ports

* Updating passwords or ports

* Migrate servers between accounts or locations


We strictly operate as an infrastructure provider. 
Our team never accesses customer servers or performs internal configuration changes. This policy ensures your environment remains fully private and under your control.
