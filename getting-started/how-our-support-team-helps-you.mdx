## **Support Boundaries for Your Security** 🚫

To ensure your privacy and security, our infrastructure-focused support doesn’t include:

* Changing configurations

* Updating passwords or ports

* Migrating servers to another account or location

We strictly operate as an infrastructure provider and do not access customer servers or perform software configurations. This ensures your data remains secure and private.
