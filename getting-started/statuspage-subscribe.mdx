# How to Subscribe for Status Updates

At **EDIS Global**, we provide services across **50 locations worldwide**. We understand that receiving updates for every location can be overwhelming, especially if you only need notifications for specific regions or services. That's why we allow our users to **customize** the notifications they receive by **subscribing only to updates** relevant to their services and locations.

Follow the steps below to manage and personalize your subscription to our **statuspage**:

## 1. Access the EDIS Global Statuspage

Start by visiting the EDIS Global Statuspage at [status.edis.global](https://status.edis.global). This page provides real-time updates about the status of our services in different locations worldwide.

## 2. Subscribe for Location-Specific Updates

### Step 1: Click Subscribe

Once you are on the statuspage, click the **"Subscribe"** button at the top-right of the page.

### Step 2: Enter Your Email Address

A popup will appear asking for your email address. Enter the email address where you want to receive status updates, then click **"Start subscription"**.

### Step 3: Confirm Subscription via Magic Link

After entering your email, you will receive a confirmation email containing a **Magic Link**. The email will look like this:

Click on the **"Sign in to EDIS Global Status"** button in the email. This will confirm your subscription and allow you to choose your notification preferences.

## 3. Customize Notifications for Specific Locations

Once you have signed up, you can manage your subscription by choosing specific locations or services for which you want to receive updates. You can pick only the locations that matter to you to reduce unnecessary notifications.

- **Step 1**: Navigate to the section listing all available locations or services (e.g., **KVM Europe**, **KVM North- and Latin America**, etc.).
- **Step 2**: Click on the ðŸ”” **bell icon** next to the location or service you want to follow.
  - For example, if you have services in **Frankfurt, Germany**, click the bell icon next to that location. This allows you to receive updates only for Frankfurt, reducing notification clutter from regions you donâ€™t use.

## 4. Notification Methods

You can choose how you'd like to receive your updates. There are several options available based on your preferences:

- **Email**: Receive updates directly in your inbox.
- **Slack**: Receive updates in a designated Slack channel by integrating with your workspace.
- **Microsoft Teams**: Get notifications directly in your Microsoft Teams workspace.

You can set up your preferred notification method by following these steps:

- After clicking the bell icon, select **how you'd like to be notified** from the options provided:
  - **Email**
  - **Slack**
  - **Microsoft Teams**

You can also **unsubscribe** at any time by returning to the statuspage and selecting "Unsubscribe completely" if you no longer wish to receive updates.

## 5. Why Subscribe?

Subscribing ensures youâ€™re not only notified about **real-time updates** but also receive **advance notice about planned maintenance**. This allows you to proactively inform your own users or customers in a timely manner.

By subscribing, youâ€™ll receive targeted alerts about maintenance, downtimes, and performance issues specific to your services and locations. Youâ€™ll always stay informed and ready to act, while **avoiding irrelevant notifications from regions where you donâ€™t have services**.
