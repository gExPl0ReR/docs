## What is a Secure Shell (SSH)

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a secure network protocol that enables remote control of computers over an unsecured network. SSH establishes a secure, encrypted connection between client and server machines, providing a secure path for data exchange and remote system control. The usage of SSH is highly recommended because it ensures that all data and actions are encrypted and secure, preventing unwanted access and data leakage.

### How to use SSH to connect to your remote VPS

To use SSH to connect to your remote VPS, follow these steps: Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine and type:

```shell
ssh username@remote-host
```

Replace **"username"** with your VPS username (_generally root and emailed to you after a VPS purchase_) and **"remote-host"** with the public IPv4 address of your VPS.&#x20;

If this is the first time you are connecting, you will be prompted to accept the remote server's public key. Type "yes" and press Enter, then enter your VPS password when prompted.

If the connection is successful, you'll see a welcome message from the remote server, and you'll be presented with a command prompt in the remote server's shell. You can then run remote commands and upload/download files as needed using the SSH connection.

_Make sure you have SSH access enabled and have the correct user credentials to log in to the VPS._

After you are finish with any tasks with the remote server you can simply type:

```shell
exit
```

You will be logged out.
