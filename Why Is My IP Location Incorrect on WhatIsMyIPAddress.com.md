### **IP Address Geolocation Data Displayed Incorrectly on WhatIsMyIPAddress.com**

**Introduction**

Sometimes, users notice that their IP location appears incorrectly on sites like *WhatIsMyIPAddress.com*. At EDIS, we are dedicated to accurate geolocation for our IP addresses, but variations between database providers can lead to discrepancies. This guide explains why these differences occur and provides steps you can take to correct your IP's location.

#### **Why Do IP Location Discrepancies Happen?**

IP geolocation relies on third-party databases that interpret IP addresses’ physical locations. Sites like *WhatIsMyIPAddress.com* pull data from sources like IP2Location, which may not always reflect real-time updates. Discrepancies can arise when providers use outdated or aggregated data.

#### **How IP Geolocation is Maintained**

IP address geolocation is managed primarily by regional network organizations. These databases are updated regularly, but third-party services sometimes lag, especially when using free or older databases. As a result, IPs may show locations that are outdated or incorrect.

---

#### **Common Reasons for Incorrect Geolocation**

1. **Old Database Records**: Some providers update their data less frequently, leading to outdated location information.
2. **Mixed Data Sources**: Aggregated data from multiple providers can sometimes mix locations.
3. **User Input**: Certain providers allow users to submit location changes, which can introduce inaccuracies.
4. **Commercial Interest**: Providers often limit free access to older data to encourage subscription purchases, affecting location accuracy on free lookup sites.

#### **Steps to Take if Your IP Shows Incorrectly**

If your IP location appears incorrect:
1. **Verify with Multiple Sources**: Try sites like [IPLocation.net](https://www.iplocation.net), which uses multiple databases, to check if the issue is specific to one provider.
2. **Contact the Site Directly**: Some services offer contact options to update IP location data.
3. **Reach Out to EDIS**: If you’re a client, we can confirm that your IP is correctly registered in major databases and provide guidance.

#### **Conclusion**

While EDIS maintains accurate geolocation data with several trusted providers, discrepancies can still appear on sites that use outdated information.
