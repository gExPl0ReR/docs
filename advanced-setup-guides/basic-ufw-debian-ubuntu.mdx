## Introduction to UFW

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a user-friendly interface for managing `iptables` firewall rules on Linux systems. It's particularly well-suited for Debian and Ubuntu servers, providing a simplified way to configure your system's firewall.

## Installation

Install UFW using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
```

## Basic UFW Commands

### Check UFW Status

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

This command shows if UFW is active and lists all current rules.

For a more detailed view, use:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```

### Enable and Disable UFW

<Warning>
  Before enabling UFW, ensure you have configured rules to allow SSH access (port 22)
  to prevent being locked out of your server.
</Warning>

To enable UFW:
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

To disable UFW:
```bash
sudo ufw disable
```

## Managing Basic Rules

### Allow Incoming Connections

Allow specific ports:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22    # Allow SSH
sudo ufw allow 80    # Allow HTTP
sudo ufw allow 443   # Allow HTTPS
```

Allow specific services by name:
```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
```

### Deny Incoming Connections

Deny specific ports:
```bash
sudo ufw deny 23     # Deny Telnet
```

### Delete Rules

Delete rules by number:
1. List rules with numbers:
```bash
sudo ufw status numbered
```

2. Delete a specific rule:
```bash
sudo ufw delete [number]
```

Delete rules by specification:
```bash
sudo ufw delete allow 80
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Allow Specific IP Addresses

Allow a specific IP address:
```bash
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.4
```

Allow an IP address to access a specific port:
```bash
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.4 to any port 22
```

### Configure Default Policies

Set default policies for incoming and outgoing traffic:
```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Allow SSH First**
   Before enabling UFW, ensure SSH access is allowed:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow ssh
   ```

2. **Use Specific Rules**
   Instead of allowing all traffic to a port, specify the service and protocol:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
   ```

3. **Regular Audits**
   Regularly review your firewall rules:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status verbose
   ```

4. **Backup Rules**
   Backup your UFW rules periodically:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/ufw/user.rules /etc/ufw/user.rules.backup
   ```

## Common Configuration Examples

### Basic Web Server Setup
```bash
# Allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
```

### Database Server Setup
```bash
# Allow MySQL/MariaDB from specific IP
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.4 to any port 3306
```

### Rate Limiting
Enable rate limiting for SSH to prevent brute force attacks:
```bash
sudo ufw limit ssh
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check UFW Status**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status verbose
   ```

2. **View UFW Logs**
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/ufw.log
   ```

3. **Reset UFW**
   If needed, reset UFW to default settings:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw reset
   ```

## Conclusion

UFW provides a straightforward way to manage your firewall rules on Debian and Ubuntu systems. Remember to always configure SSH access before enabling the firewall, and regularly audit your rules to maintain security.
