# Setting Up OpenVPN over Stunnel on Ubuntu 22.04

## Introduction

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to set up OpenVPN over Stunnel on Ubuntu 22.04. By encapsulating OpenVPN traffic within an SSL tunnel using Stunnel, you can enhance security and potentially bypass network restrictions or firewalls that block or throttle VPN connections.

## Prerequisites

- **VPS Server:**
  - An <a href="https://www.edisglobal.com" target="_blank">EDIS Global VPS</a> running Ubuntu 22.04.
  - Root or sudo access.
- **Client Machine:**
  - A computer running Ubuntu or any Linux distribution compatible with OpenVPN and Stunnel.
  - Root or sudo access.

## Overview

We will perform the following high-level steps:

1. **On the VPS Server:**
   - Install and configure Stunnel.
   - Install and configure OpenVPN.
2. **On the Client Machine:**
   - Install and configure Stunnel.
   - Configure OpenVPN to connect through Stunnel.

---

## Steps on the VPS Server

### 1. Update and Upgrade System Packages

Ensure your system packages are up to date.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**Explanation:** This updates the package list and upgrades installed packages to their latest versions, ensuring you have the latest security patches and features.

### 2. Install Stunnel

Install Stunnel, which will be used to create an SSL tunnel for OpenVPN traffic.

```bash
sudo apt install stunnel4 -y
```

**Explanation:** Installs the Stunnel package, allowing you to encrypt arbitrary TCP connections inside SSL.

### 3. Generate SSL Certificates for Stunnel

Navigate to the Stunnel configuration directory and generate a self-signed SSL certificate.

```bash
cd /etc/stunnel
sudo openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out stunnel.pem -keyout stunnel.pem
```

**Explanation:**

- `openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes`: Generates a new X.509 certificate valid for 365 days without a passphrase (`-nodes`).
- `-out stunnel.pem -keyout stunnel.pem`: Outputs both the certificate and the private key to `stunnel.pem`.

**Note:** You'll be prompted to enter information (Country, State, etc.). You can fill these out or leave them blank.

### 4. Create a Log File for Stunnel

Create a log file for Stunnel to write logs.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/stunnel
sudo touch /var/log/stunnel/stunnel.log
sudo chown stunnel4:stunnel4 /var/log/stunnel/stunnel.log
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a directory for Stunnel logs.
- Creates an empty log file and sets appropriate ownership.

### 5. Configure Stunnel

Open the Stunnel configuration file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf
```

Add the following configuration:

```conf
# Global options
output = /var/log/stunnel/stunnel.log

# Service-level options
[openvpn]
client = no
accept = 443
connect = 127.0.0.1:1194
cert = /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem
```

**Explanation:**

- `output`: Specifies where to write log output.
- `[openvpn]`: Defines a service named "openvpn".
- `client = no`: Runs Stunnel in server mode.
- `accept = 443`: Listens on port 443 (common HTTPS port, often allowed through firewalls).
- `connect = 127.0.0.1:1194`: Forwards incoming connections to the local OpenVPN service.
- `cert`: Specifies the SSL certificate file.

### 6. Enable and Start Stunnel Service

Enable Stunnel to start on boot and start the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable stunnel4
sudo systemctl restart stunnel4
sudo systemctl status stunnel4
```

**Explanation:**

- `enable`: Ensures Stunnel starts on system boot.
- `restart`: Starts or restarts the Stunnel service.
- `status`: Checks if Stunnel is running correctly.

### 7. Install OpenVPN

Download and run the OpenVPN installation script.

```bash
cd ~
wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh
sudo bash openvpn-install.sh
```

**Explanation:** This script automates OpenVPN installation and configuration. It will prompt for configuration optionsâ€”choose settings that suit your needs.

### 8. Modify OpenVPN Server Configuration

Edit the OpenVPN server configuration file to listen on all interfaces.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf
```

Find and modify the `local` directive:

```conf
# Comment out if present:
# local 127.0.0.1

# Or add:
local 0.0.0.0
```

**Explanation:** Setting `local 0.0.0.0` ensures OpenVPN listens on all network interfaces.

### 9. Restart OpenVPN Service

Apply the configuration changes.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart openvpn-server@server.service
sudo systemctl status openvpn-server@server.service
```

**Explanation:** Restarts the OpenVPN service and verifies it's running properly.

## Steps on the Client Machine

### 1. Install Stunnel

Install Stunnel on the client machine.

```bash
sudo apt install stunnel4 -y
```

### 2. Configure Stunnel

Navigate to the Stunnel configuration directory and create the configuration file.

```bash
cd /etc/stunnel
sudo nano stunnel.conf
```

Add the following configuration:

```conf
client = yes

[openvpn]
accept = 127.0.0.1:1194
connect = VPS_IP_ADDRESS:443
```

**Explanation:**

- `client = yes`: Runs Stunnel in client mode.
- `accept = 127.0.0.1:1194`: Listens locally on port 1194.
- `connect = VPS_IP_ADDRESS:443`: Connects to the VPS server's Stunnel service.

**Note:** Replace `VPS_IP_ADDRESS` with your actual VPS server IP.

### 3. Enable and Start Stunnel Service

Enable Stunnel to start on boot and start the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable stunnel4
sudo systemctl restart stunnel4
sudo systemctl status stunnel4
```

### 4. Copy OpenVPN Client Configuration File

Securely copy the OpenVPN client configuration file from the VPS to your client machine.

```bash
scp root@VPS_IP_ADDRESS:/root/client.ovpn ~/
```

**Explanation:** Copies `client.ovpn` to your home directory.

**Note:** Replace `VPS_IP_ADDRESS` with your VPS IP.

### 5. Modify OpenVPN Client Configuration

Rename and edit the OpenVPN client configuration file.

```bash
sudo mv ~/client.ovpn /etc/openvpn/client.conf
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/client.conf
```

Modify the following:

- Change the `remote` directive to point to the local Stunnel endpoint:
- Add or modify the following directives:
- Optionally, specify a log file:

**Explanation:**

- `remote 127.0.0.1 1194`: Connects OpenVPN to the local Stunnel service.
- `route-nopull`: Prevents automatic route changes.
- `script-security 2`: Allows the execution of scripts.
- `route-up`: Executes a script after connection is established.

### 6. Create a Routing Script

Create a script to adjust routing after connecting.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/routing.sh
```

Add the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SERVER_IP="VPS_IP_ADDRESS"
GATEWAY=$(ip route get 8.8.8.8 | grep -oP 'via \K\S+')
sudo ip route add $SERVER_IP/32 via $GATEWAY
sudo ip route add 0.0.0.0/1 via 10.8.0.1
sudo ip route add 128.0.0.0/1 via 10.8.0.1
```

**Explanation:**

- `SERVER_IP`: Your VPS server IP.
- `GATEWAY`: Determines the default gateway to route traffic to the VPS server outside the VPN tunnel.
- The `ip route add` commands adjust the routing table.

**Note:** Replace `VPS_IP_ADDRESS` with your VPS IP.

Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/openvpn/routing.sh
```

### 7. Start OpenVPN Client

Start the OpenVPN client service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable openvpn-client@client.service
sudo systemctl start openvpn-client@client.service
sudo systemctl status openvpn-client@client.service
```

**Explanation:** Enables and starts the OpenVPN client using the modified configuration.

## Verification

### 1. Check IP Address

Before and after starting the VPN, check your public IP to ensure traffic is routed through the VPN.

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

### 2. Verify Services

Check that Stunnel and OpenVPN services are running.

```bash
sudo systemctl status stunnel4
sudo systemctl status openvpn-client@client.service
```

### 3. Test Connectivity

Ensure you can access internet resources and that traffic is routed through the VPN.

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
traceroute google.com
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Stunnel Connection Refused:**
  - Ensure the VPS firewall allows incoming connections on port 443.
  - Verify Stunnel is running on the VPS: `sudo systemctl status stunnel4`.
- **OpenVPN Authentication Failed:**
  - Check that client and server certificates match.
  - Review OpenVPN logs on both client and server for errors.
- **Routing Issues:**
  - Verify the `routing.sh` script has the correct server IP.
  - Ensure the script is executable and the path is correct in the OpenVPN config.
- **Service Fails to Start:**
  - Review logs: `journalctl -xe` or specific service logs.
  - Check for typos or syntax errors in configuration files.
