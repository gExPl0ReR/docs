### RegreSSHion: Critical OpenSSH Vulnerability Allowing Root Access

Security researchers have identified a critical vulnerability in OpenSSH, dubbed "RegreSSHion," which allows attackers to gain root access. This exploit, stemming from a bug first discovered in 2006, requires patience as it takes several hours to execute successfully.

### What is RegreSSHion?

The term "regression" refers to a previously fixed bug that reappears due to changes in the source code. The RegreSSHion bug, CVE-2024-6387, is a race condition that occurs when unsuccessful SSH connections are terminated. If a client does not send authentication data within 120 seconds, the SSH server sends a SIGALRM signal to log the event, which can be exploited to insert malicious code.

### Affected Versions

The following OpenSSH versions are vulnerable:

- Versions before 4.4p1 (unless patched for CVE-2006-5051 or CVE-2008-4109)
- Versions 8.5p1 to 9.8 (first fixed in version 9.8p1)

### How to update SSHD

We created an article how to [Update SSHD on Debian, Ubuntu and Red Hat Linux](./update-sshd-debian-ubuntu-redhat)

### Exploit Details

Exploiting this vulnerability requires bypassing various security mechanisms and significant patience. The exploit works roughly one in ten thousand attempts, primarily on 32-bit systems. With 100 parallel connections, the attack can succeed in six to eight hours, but default settings usually allow only ten connections, extending the attack duration.

### Practical Implications

Researchers successfully exploited the bug in OpenSSH 9.2p1 under Debian GNU/Linux. Currently, only glibc-based systems are vulnerable, with OpenBSD being immune.

### Recommendations

Admins should ensure their Linux systems have the latest OpenSSH versions. Both Debian and Ubuntu have released updated packages:

- [Debian Security Announcement](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2024/msg00135.html)
- [Ubuntu Security Notice](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6859-1)

Red Hat is still investigating, with initial analyses showing only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 is affected.

### Summary

The RegreSSHion vulnerability highlights the importance of keeping software up to date. Ensure your systems are protected by updating to OpenSSH 9.8p1 or later.
