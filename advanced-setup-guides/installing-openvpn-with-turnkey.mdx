## Installing OpenVPN Community Edition via Turnkey

**OpenVPN®**  Community Edition provides a full-featured open source SSL/TLS Virtual Private Network (VPN). The TurnKey Linux VPN software appliance leverages the open source 'openvpn-server', 'openvpn-client' and 'easy-rsa' software (developed by OpenVPN® Inc.) to support "site-to-site" or "gateway" access. "Site-to-site" can link 2 otherwise unconnected LANs; suitable for multi-site enterprise networks or linkage to an Amazon VPC. "Gateway" configuration can secure traffic across public and/or insecure wifi connections and/or provide a secure solution for remote work scenarios.

## Credentials & Administration

For security reasons, there are **no default passwords**. All passwords are set at **system initialization** (in the VNC session).

**Ignore browser SSL warnings**: browsers show warnings when using self-signed SSL certificates. This is the only certificate that can be generated automatically. If you have a domain name configured,  you can generate a free **Let's Encypt SSL certificate** via **Confconsole Advanced menu**.

**Web** - point your browser to

1. [`http://12.34.56.789/`](http://12.34.56.789/) - not encrypted, no browser warning

2. [`https://12.34.56.789/`](https://12.34.56.789/) - encrypted with self-signed SSL certificate
