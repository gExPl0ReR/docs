## Installing OpenVPN Community Edition via Turnkey

**OpenVPN®**  Community Edition provides a full-featured open source SSL/TLS Virtual Private Network (VPN). The TurnKey Linux VPN software appliance leverages the open source 'openvpn-server', 'openvpn-client' and 'easy-rsa' software (developed by OpenVPN® Inc.) to support "site-to-site" or "gateway" access. "Site-to-site" can link 2 otherwise unconnected LANs; suitable for multi-site enterprise networks or linkage to an Amazon VPC. "Gateway" configuration can secure traffic across public and/or insecure wifi connections and/or provide a secure solution for remote work scenarios.



## How to Install a Turnkey Image

Download the .iso Image from https://www.turnkeylinux.org/openvpn to your computer, and use our Cusom ISO function to upload the file to your server and have it installed.

After the initial installation process of the .iso is completed, the Turnkey OpenVPN Software appliance will be deployed on your VPS. 

**Finish the installation in a VNC session.**



## Credentials & Administration

For security reasons, there are **no default passwords**. All passwords are set at **system initialization** (in the VNC session).

**Ignore browser SSL warnings**: browsers show warnings when using self-signed SSL certificates. This is the only certificate that can be generated automatically. If you have a domain name configured,  you can generate a free **Let's Encypt SSL certificate** via **Confconsole Advanced menu**.

**Web** - point your browser to

1. [`http://12.34.56.789/`](http://12.34.56.789/) - not encrypted, no browser warning

2. [`https://12.34.56.789/`](https://12.34.56.789/) - encrypted with self-signed SSL certificate

**Username for OS system administration**:

Login as **root**

1. Point your browser to:

* [`https://12.34.56.789:12321/`](https://12.34.56.789:12321/) - System control panel

* [`https://12.34.56.789:12320/`](https://12.34.56.789:12320/) - Web-based command line terminal

1. Login with SSH client:

```shell
ssh root@12.34.56.789
```

\*Replace `12.34.56.789` with your KVM IP address
