# Turnkey Images (Deprecated)

> ⚠️ **This article is deprecated.**  
> Turnkey Linux images are **no longer supported** on EDIS Global VPS platforms.

Turnkey-based installations were previously used to deploy pre-configured virtual appliances such as **OpenVPN**, **WordPress**, and similar systems.  
These images have been discontinued due to compatibility and stability issues with current virtualization environments.

## 🧭 Recommended Alternatives

To install applications or operating systems on your VPS, use one of the supported deployment methods below:

### 1. Auto-Install a Supported OS
Reinstall your VPS with a clean Linux or Windows image using the **AutoInstall OS** feature in your [EDIS Global Control Panel](https://manage.edisglobal.com/clientarea.php).  
This ensures full compatibility with current hosting infrastructure and networking configurations.

---

### 2. Bring Your Own Image (Cloud-Init)
If you need a specific configuration or custom distribution, you can upload your own **.qcow2 image** and automate setup using **Cloud-Init user-data scripts**.  
This method replaces the old Turnkey workflow and gives full control over system initialization.

## 🔒 Why Turnkey Was Removed

- Frequent version mismatches and outdated software stacks  
- Inconsistent network configuration on newer KVM nodes  
- Lack of long-term maintenance from upstream Turnkey Linux  
- Improved reliability and automation via Cloud-Init

If you previously relied on Turnkey images for fast deployments, we recommend switching to **Cloud-Init templates** or the **Auto-Install OS** feature — both offer faster, more reliable, and up-to-date installations.
