## Introduction

For KVM VPS users who wish to enhance their online presence with a unique domain name, this guide walks you through the process of domain registration and linking it to your VPS.

## Step 1:  Register a Domain

**Choosing a Domain Registrar:**
You can purchase a domain from any domain registrar. Some popular options include:

* GoDaddy

* Namecheap

* Google Domains

**Procedure:**

1. Visit the website of the chosen registrar.

2. Use the search function to choose your domain (e.g., "myawesomeproject.com").

3. Complete the purchase, ensuring that DNS hosting is included in your domain plan. Alternatively, you can use [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/dns/), it is AnyCast + free of charge.

## **Step 2: Linking the Domain to Your VPS**

**Locating Your VPS IP Address:**
Your VPS IP address is provided by EDIS Global upon the activation of your KVM VPS plan. You also find it in the VPS panel.

**Configuring DNS Records:**

1. Access your domain registrar's control panel and navigate to the DNS settings.

2. Create a new "A" record:

   * Set the "Host" to @ to denote your domain.

   * Input your VPS IP address in the provided field.

3. Save your new DNS configuration.

**DNS Propagation Time:**
The changes may take anywhere from a few minutes up to 48 hours to fully propagate.

## Additional Information

* **DNS Propagation:** If your website does not become accessible immediately, please allow the necessary time for DNS propagation.

* **Support:** Should you require assistance with finding your VPS IP address or have any concerns, please contact EDIS Global Support.
