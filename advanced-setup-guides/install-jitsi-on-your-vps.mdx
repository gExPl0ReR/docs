## Install Jitsi Meet on Linux

Jitsi is an open-source video conferencing software that allows for video calls, screen sharing, and many other features. Here's a basic guide to installing Jitsi Meet on a VPS (we'll use Ubuntu for this example):

### **1. Prepare Your Server:**

Make sure you have a server (e.g., VPS) running Ubuntu. Ensure your server has a public IP address.

### **2. Update Your System:**

Before you start, always good to make sure your server's package list and software is up to date:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### **3. Set Up a Domain:**

For Jitsi to work properly with SSL (which you want for security), you'll need a domain name. Make sure to point your domain to your server's IP address using DNS settings.

### **4. Install Jitsi:**

a. First, add the Jitsi repository to your sources list:

```shell
echo 'deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list
```

b. Next, download the signing key for the repository:

```shell
wget -qO - https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

c. Now, update your package list:

```shell
sudo apt update
```

d. Finally, install Jitsi Meet:

```shell
sudo apt install jitsi-meet -y
```

During the installation, you'll be prompted to enter the hostname (your domain). Enter the domain you prepared. After this, you'll be asked to generate a new SSL certificate or use your own. For simplicity, select 'Generate a new self-signed certificate.'

### **5. Secure Jitsi with a Real SSL Certificate:**

a. Install `certbot` (this is for Let's Encrypt SSL certificates):

```shell
sudo apt install certbot -y
```

b. Now, fetch and install the certificate:

```shell
sudo /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh
```

Follow the prompt. This script will handle the certificate retrieval and configuration for you.

### **6. Access Jitsi:**

Now, in any web browser, go to `https://yourdomain.com` (replace "yourdomain.com" with your actual domain). You should see the Jitsi Meet interface where you can start or join a meeting.

That's it! You now have a basic Jitsi Meet server set up. There are many more advanced settings and configurations you can dive into if needed, but this will get you started with a basic installation.
