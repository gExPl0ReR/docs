description: "Learn how to install the WireGuard client on Ubuntu 22.04 and connect to a VPN using amneziawg configuration. Step-by-step guide for a secure and seamless VPN setup."
---

To connect to a Wideguard VPN from your local machine to a remote server using the AmneziaWG configuration file you previously received from the configured server, follow these steps. This guide assumes you are using Ubuntu 22.04. You’ll need to install the WireGuard software, configure it, and initiate the VPN connection. Here's how to do it:

### 1. Change sources.list on the client's operation system:

Open a terminal and back up your sources.list:

```shell
sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
```

Edit the File:

```shell
nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

**Uncomment deb-src Lines**: Remove the `#` from the beginning of any `deb-src` lines you want to activate.

```shell
#Example sources.list file for Ubuntu 22.04
# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to
# newer versions of the distribution.
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy main restricted
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy main restricted

```

**Save and Exit**.

### 2. Make upgrade system:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade && apt-get full-upgrade && apt install resolvconf
```

### 3. Install AmneziaWG on Ubuntu 22.04:

```bash
apt install -y software-properties-common python3-launchpadlib gnupg2 linux-headers-$(uname -r)

add-apt-repository ppa:amnezia/ppa

apt-get install -y amneziawg
```

Check the availability of all necessary drivers in the system:

```bash
lsmod | grep amnezia
```

If the command doesn't show any outputs execute this command:

```bash
modprobe amneziawg && lsmod | grep amnezia
```

### 4. Copy amneziawg client config on Linux(Ubuntu):

Include the command:

```shell
scp [username]@[server-ip-address]:/root/awg/wg-client1.conf /etc/amnezia/amneziawg/
```

Where:

* username - the username of the server

* server-ip-address - the IP address of the server

* /root/awg/ - directory where located a wireguard config files

* wg-client1.conf - wireguard config file

* /etc/amnezia/amneziawg/ - the local directory on your Linux machine

### 5. Get Your WireGuard Configuration

The Amnezia wireguard configuration file must be downloaded from VPS. The `.conf` file, is usually in the following format:

```shell
[Interface]
PrivateKey = kHcPwRvI3FRc4qcE+Fgrln1K1qxQNM3jl4CpPzaYx4o=
#_PublicKey = 7vzU3tVk39Dj+XvjpX3e9yZzDZhfbTZUde2Elju3nRM=
Address = 10.10.8.2/32
DNS = 8.8.8.8
Jc = 120
Jmin = 60
Jmax = 1266
S1 = 11
S2 = 54
H1 = 563549684
H2 = 1544213701
H3 = 529241130
H4 = 981267317

[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/5, 8.0.0.0/7, 11.0.0.0/8, 12.0.0.0/6, 16.0.0.0/4, 32.0.0.0/3, 64.0.0.0/2, 128.0.0.0/3, 160.0.0.0/5, 168.0.0.0/6, 172.0.0.0/12, 172.32.0.0/11, 172.64.0.0/10, 172.128.0.0/9, 173.0.0.0/8, 174.0.0.0/7, 176.0.0.0/4, 192.0.0.0/9, 192.128.0.0/11, 192.160.0.0/13, 192.169.0.0/16, 192.170.0.0/15, 192.172.0.0/14, 192.176.0.0/12, 192.192.0.0/10, 193.0.0.0/8, 194.0.0.0/7, 196.0.0.0/6, 200.0.0.0/5, 208.0.0.0/4, 8.8.8.8/32
Endpoint = VPS_REMOTE_IP:54666
PersistentKeepalive = 60
PublicKey = 7gExcFjYZ6rR5nU7F3xzrDQchtGu4OCxEwGjSlRGwnE=
```

Save this file with a `.conf` extension, e.g., `wg0.conf`.

### 6. Move Configuration to AmneziaWG Directory

Move your configuration file to AmneziaWG’s directory, where wg-client1.conf this is a client config that was previously downloaded from the server:

```shell
sudo mv /etc/amnezia/amneziawg/wg-client1.conf /etc/amnezia/amneziawg/wg0.conf
```

Ensure the file permissions are restricted to prevent unauthorized access:

```shell
sudo chmod 600 /etc/amnezia/amneziawg/wg0.conf
```

### 7. Start the WireGuard VPN Connection

To start the VPN connection using the configuration file, run the following command:

```shell
sudo awg-quick up wg0
```

If everything is configured properly, you'll be connected to the WireGuard VPN.

### 8. Verify the Connection

To check if the connection is active, use:

```shell
awg show
ip 
```

This command shows details about the active WireGuard connection, such as the interface name, peer details, and data transfer statistics.

### 9. Disconnect from the VPN

To stop the VPN connection, use:

```shell
sudo awg-quick down wg0
```

### 10. Optionally Enable WireGuard on Boot

If you want the VPN to start automatically on boot, you can enable it with:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable awg-quick@wg0
```

To disable it from starting on boot, use:

```shell
sudo systemctl disable awg-quick@wg0
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:

* Ensure that your private key, public key, and endpoint details in the configuration are correct.

* If you face any connection issues, check the system logs for more detailed error messages:

```shell
sudo journalctl -xe
```

Following these steps, you should be able to connect to AmneziaWG on Ubuntu.
