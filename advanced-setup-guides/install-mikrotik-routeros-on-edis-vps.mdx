## Mikrotik CHR (Cloud Hosted Router)

If you want to give Mikrotik CHR a try, you can download images from the official <a href="https://mikrotik.com/download" target="_blank">Mikrotik download page</a>. To make life easy for you, we converted a couple of <a href="https://files.edisglobal.com/index.php/s/Jph4RkS7Cgw0ryY" target="_blank">cloud images</a> downloaded from the Mikrotik website, which can be used with our Cloud-Init installer 😎

    it will change to: Server Status: RUNNING, **AUTOINSTALL IN PROGRESS**

    **The installation will take a couple of minutes!**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Once the installer is done (Server Status: RUNNING)">
    start a VNC session, start noVNC, click into the noVNC window (set focus)

## Configure Static IPv4 in MikroTik

Log into MikroTik Router:

* Use a **VNC session** to connect to your MikroTik router.

* Log in with your credentials (by default, the username is `admin`, and there is no password unless you changed it).

### Set Static IPv4 Address:

After logging into MikroTik, use the **Terminal** window and enter the following commands to configure the static IP:

**Assign Static IP Address**:
Use this command to set a static IP on the interface you want (e.g., `ether1`):

```bash
ip/address/add address=192.168.1.100/24 interface=ether1
```

* Replace `192.168.1.100/24` with your VPS static IP and subnet mask.

* Replace `ether1` with the correct interface if it's different.

**Set Gateway (Default Route)**:
To configure a default gateway, use the following command:

```bash
ip/route/add gateway=192.168.1.1
```

* Replace `192.168.1.1` with your VPS default gateway IP address

**Set DNS Servers**:
To configure DNS servers (for example, using Google DNS), use:

```bash
ip/dns/set servers=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
```

* You can use any DNS servers, such as `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1` for Cloudflare’s public DNS resolvers.

### Verify Your Configuration:

Please reboot the server with the following command to apply the changes and set up the network:

```bash
system/reboot
```

* After the server has rebooted, you can connect to the server via **Winbox**, the **web interface**, or **SSH** using the IP address you configured.

## Configure IPv6 address in MikroTik

To configure the imaginary IPv6 address **2a03:f80:22:4198::1** on a **MikroTik CHR** device, follow these steps:Always refer to your VPS dashboard for the correct I/64 Pv6 address assignment-.

### **Assign the IPv6 Address**

1. **Open your MikroTik terminal** or connect via **Winbox**.

2. **Add the IPv6 address** to the desired interface (e.g., ether1).

```bash
/ipv6 address add address=2a03:f80:22:4198::1/48 interface=ether1
```

• Replace ether1 with the actual interface you are using. Replace `2a03:f80:22:4198::` with your own VPS IPv6 range.

Remember that the **subnet mask is configured as /48** while the size of your allocation remains /64.

### Configure the IPv6 Default Route

1. **Add the default route** for IPv6 to allow external communication.

```bash
/ipv6 route add dst-address=::/0 gateway=2a03:f80:22::1
```

• **Note**: This example uses 2a03:f80:22::1 as the gateway. Your gateway consists of the first three segments of your IP address and ::1

### **Verify the Configuration**

1. **Check the assigned IPv6 address**:

```bash
/ipv6 address print
```

1. **Check the default route**:

```bash
/ipv6 route print
```

This configuration will allow your MikroTik CHR to use the imaginary IPv6 address **2a03:f80:22:4198::1** and establish external connectivity via the default gateway. Remember that the **subnet mask is configured as /48**, not /64.
