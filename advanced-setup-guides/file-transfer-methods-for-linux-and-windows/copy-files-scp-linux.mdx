## Secure Copy Files Between Linux and Linux Servers

SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) is a simple and secure way to transfer files between your Linux machine and a Linux server. This article explains how to use the `scp` command in the Linux terminal to copy files to and from a Linux server.

***

## Step 1: Ensure SSH is Enabled on the Linux Server

Make sure the SSH service is installed and running on your Linux server. Use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```

## Step 2: Use the `scp` Command to Transfer Files

### Copy a File from Local to Remote Server

To upload a file from your local machine to the Linux server:

```bash
scp /path/to/local/file username@hostname_or_ip:/path/to/remote/directory
```

* Replace `/path/to/local/file` with the full path to the file on your local machine.

* Replace `username` with your Linux server username.

* Replace `hostname_or_ip` with your server’s IP address or domain name.

* Replace `/path/to/remote/directory` with the target directory on the server.

### Copy a File from Remote Server to Local Machine

To download a file from the Linux server to your local machine:

```bash
scp username@hostname_or_ip:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory
```

* Replace `/path/to/remote/file` with the file’s path on the server.

* Replace `/path/to/local/directory` with the target directory on your local machine.
