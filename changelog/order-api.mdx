## Changelog Order API

Updates and improvements

<Update label="March 2025">
  ## **Plan Description Field in Order API Now Uses Structured Object Format**

  The plan description field in the Order API has been updated from a single unstructured HTML string to a structured, machine-readable object. This change separates data from presentation, making it easier to parse, localize, and display consistently across interfaces.

  ---

  **üßæ Before**

  ```
  [KVM DIAMOND] => stdClass Object
  (
      [id] => 1834
      [description] => "8192 MB RAM 1 CPU core 100 GB SSD ... <strong>30 TB Traffic</strong> ..."
  )
  ```

  ‚Ä¢ The description is a **single HTML string**.

  ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs meant for direct display on a webpage.

  ‚Ä¢ Parsing values (like RAM or CPU) requires regex or manual parsing.

  ‚Ä¢ Difficult to localize or transform programmatically.

  ‚Ä¢ Mixes data and presentation (\<br /\>, \<strong\>).

  ---

  ‚úÖ **After**

  ```
  [KVM DIAMOND] => stdClass Object
  (
      [id] => 1834
      [description] => stdClass Object
          (
              [disk] => stdClass Object
                  (
                      [size] => 100
                      [unit] => GByte
                  )
              [ram] => stdClass Object
                  (
                      [size] => 8192
                      [unit] => MByte
                  )
              ...
          )
  )
  ```

  ‚Ä¢ The description is now a **nested structured object**.

  ‚Ä¢ Clear separation of values and units (size, unit).

  ‚Ä¢ Much easier to: Sort, filter, or validate

  ‚Ä¢ Render dynamically in different formats (HTML, plain text, JSON)

  ‚Ä¢ Translate units or localize for different languages

  ‚Ä¢ **Presentation logic can be handled elsewhere** (frontend templates, markdown renderers, etc.)

  ---

  **üí° Why this change is good**

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Easier to maintain and update

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Enables internationalization

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Enables filtering (e.g. ‚Äúplans with ‚â•16‚ÄØGB RAM‚Äù)

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Keeps raw data clean and reusable
