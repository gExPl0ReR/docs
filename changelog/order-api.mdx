## Changelog Order API

Updates and improvements

<Update label="March 2025">
  ## **Plan Description Field in Order API Now Uses Structured Object Format**

  The key difference between the **‚Äúvorher‚Äù** (before) and **‚Äújetzt‚Äù** (now) structure is a shift from an **unstructured HTML string** to a **structured, machine-readable object**.

  ---

  **üßæ Before**

  ```
  [KVM DIAMOND] => stdClass Object
  (
      [id] => 1834
      [description] => "8192 MB RAM 1 CPU core 100 GB SSD ... <strong>30 TB Traffic</strong> ..."
  )
  ```

  ‚Ä¢ The description is a **single HTML string**.

  ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs meant for direct display on a webpage.

  ‚Ä¢ Parsing values (like RAM or CPU) requires regex or manual parsing.

  ‚Ä¢ Difficult to localize or transform programmatically.

  ‚Ä¢ Mixes data and presentation (\<br /\>, \<strong\>).

  ---

  **‚úÖ Now **

  ```
  [KVM DIAMOND] => stdClass Object
  (
      [id] => 1834
      [description] => stdClass Object
          (
              [disk] => stdClass Object
                  (
                      [size] => 100
                      [unit] => GByte
                  )
              [ram] => stdClass Object
                  (
                      [size] => 8192
                      [unit] => MByte
                  )
              ...
          )
  )
  ```

  ‚Ä¢ The description is now a **nested structured object**.

  ‚Ä¢ Clear separation of values and units (size, unit).

  ‚Ä¢ Much easier to:

  ‚Ä¢ Sort, filter, or validate

  ‚Ä¢ Render dynamically in different formats (HTML, plain text, JSON)

  ‚Ä¢ Translate units or localize for different languages

  ‚Ä¢ **Presentation logic can be handled elsewhere** (frontend templates, markdown renderers, etc.)

  ---

  **üí° Why this change is good**

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Easier to maintain and update

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Enables internationalization

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Enables filtering (e.g. ‚Äúplans with ‚â•16‚ÄØGB RAM‚Äù)

  ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Keeps raw data clean and reusable

  If you‚Äôre planning future API enhancements, this structure sets you up nicely for automated plan comparisons, filters, or dynamic UIs. Let me know if you‚Äôd like a pretty-printer or rendering function for this\!

  #### **The Beginning**

  This marks the very first entry in our public Order API changelog\!
