## Product Updates

Updates and improvements

<Update label="September 2025">

### September 25, 2025 — Post-Install Scripts Deprecated ⚠️➡️ Cloud-Init Only

We’ve officially **retired Post-Install Scripts** from the EDIS Global VPS platform.  
All new operating system installations now rely exclusively on **Cloud-Init**, the industry standard for automated server initialization.  

👉 Why this change?  
- **Unified automation**: Cloud-Init replaces custom Post-Install scripts with a standardized, more powerful configuration method.  
- **Faster deployments**: Inject configs directly at installation — no need for extra script execution afterwards.  
- **Broader compatibility**: Supported across nearly all Linux distributions we offer.  
- **Future-ready**: Easier scaling, improved security, and cleaner workflows.  

If you’ve used Post-Install Scripts before, don’t worry — we’ve kept the [archived documentation](https://docs.edisglobal.com/vps-management/post-install-scripts) for reference.  
For all current and future VPS setups, please use our [Cloud-Init Installation Guide](https://docs.edisglobal.com/vps-management/edis-cloud-init-vps-installation).
