## Product Updates

Updates and improvements

<Update label="December 2025">
  ### December 28, 2025 — Due-Date Reminders for Partially Paid Invoices 💳⏰

  EDIS Global applies **account credit automatically during billrun** (unless you’ve opted out of automatic credit application).\
  If the available credit is **not sufficient**, the invoice is **partially paid** and remains **unpaid** until the outstanding amount is settled.

  Starting **December 28, 2025**, we send **payment reminders at the service due date** for invoices that:

  - received a **partial credit payment**, and
  - still have an **outstanding amount due**.

  This helps ensure important renewals don’t get missed when only a small remainder are left to pay.

  #### November 11, 2025 — Global Database Cluster Upgrade ⚡➡️ Real-Time

  We’ve successfully upgraded EDIS Global from a **centralized database system** to a fully **distributed, highly resilient global database cluster**.\
  This major platform upgrade unlocks **real-time operations**, smoother performance, and a noticeably faster user experience across the entire EDIS ecosystem.

  ## What’s improved?

  - **Real-time backend operations**: Orders, transactions, and provisioning updates now propagate instantly across all regions.
  - **Faster order processing**: New VPS deployments and account actions complete more quickly and more consistently.
  - **Simplified internal architecture**: Cleaner, more efficient backend structures reduce complexity and make the platform more reliable.
  - **Resilient traffic-pool logic**: Traffic accounting and quota adjustments now run with real-time precision.
  - **Higher fault tolerance**: The distributed cluster ensures continuity even during regional outages or network disruptions.

  This upgrade brings EDIS Global another step closer to a **fully real-time, globally consistent hosting platform** — delivering a smoother, faster, and more dependable experience for all users.

<Update label="September 2025">
  ### September 25, 2025 — Post-Install Scripts Deprecated ⚠️➡️ Cloud-Init Only

  We’ve officially **retired Post-Install Scripts** from the EDIS Global VPS platform.\
  All new operating system installations now rely exclusively on **Cloud-Init**, the industry standard for automated server initialization.

  👉 Why this change?

  - **Unified automation**: Cloud-Init replaces custom Post-Install scripts with a standardized, more powerful configuration method.
  - **Faster deployments**: Inject configs directly at installation — no need for extra script execution afterwards.
  - **Broader compatibility**: Supported across nearly all Linux distributions we offer.
  - **Future-ready**: Easier scaling, improved security, and cleaner workflows.

  If you’ve used Post-Install Scripts before, don’t worry — we’ve kept the [archived documentation](https://docs.edisglobal.com/vps-management/post-install-scripts) for reference.\
  For all current and future VPS setups, please use our [Cloud-Init Installation Guide](https://docs.edisglobal.com/vps-management/edis-cloud-init-vps-installation).
