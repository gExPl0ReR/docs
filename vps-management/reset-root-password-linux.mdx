This guide outlines a simple and effective method to reset the root password on a Linux VPS without reinstalling the operating system or risking data loss. It explains how to regain access by booting the machine using a specially prepared password reset image. As EDIS supplies unmodified OS images without pre-installed KVM guest drivers, password changes via the admin panel are not supported. Nevertheless, by following the steps in this guide, you can securely set a new root password on your KVM-based Linux VPS. This method is suitable for a wide range of distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, and even Arch Linux.
