# ⚙️ System Configuration Dialog

The **System Configuration** dialog in your VPS management interface allows you to customize important hardware emulation settings. These options help optimize performance and ensure compatibility with your operating system and workloads.

Below you'll find a detailed explanation of each setting:

---

## ⏲️ Boot Menu Timeout

This setting controls how long the boot menu is displayed when your VPS starts.  
Options:

- **0 sec** – Skip the boot menu.
- **5 sec (recommended)** – Provides a short pause to access boot options if needed.
- **30 sec** – Allows extra time to select boot options.
- **60 sec** – Extended time for troubleshooting or manual selection.

For most users, **5 seconds** is ideal.

---

## 🧠 CPU Cores vs. Sockets

This setting controls how CPU resources are presented to your VPS (only valid if you have more than one vCPU)

- **Multiple Sockets**: Emulates multiple physical CPUs. Useful for certain legacy systems but can introduce overhead.
- **Multiple Cores**: Emulates multiple cores within a single CPU socket. This is more efficient and recommended for most modern systems.

## 🧩 CPU Model

This determines how the CPU is presented to the guest operating system:

- **default** – A generic, highly compatible CPU model that works well with most operating systems.
- **Host CPU Passthrough** – Passes the host's actual CPU features (like AES, SSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, etc.) to the VPS for better performance, especially with workloads that can utilize advanced instruction sets.

**Recommendation:**  
For maximum performance and compatibility, use **Host CPU Passthrough** unless your operating system has specific requirements.

---

## 🖥️ Video Driver

This defines the virtual display adapter used for the VNC remote console:

- **Cirrus**: Standard and compatible with most operating systems.
- **QXL**: Enhanced graphics performance, mostly used with SPICE-compatible systems.

For most users, **Cirrus** is sufficient. Windows might perform slightly better with **QXL**.

---

## 💾 Disk Driver

The disk driver determines how your VPS’s storage device is presented to the guest operating system:

- **Virtio (Recommended)**: High-performance paravirtualized driver. Requires Virtio drivers (Linux supports this natively; Windows may need drivers).
- **IDE**: Highly compatible but slower performance.
- **SCSI**: Balanced option for certain OS environments.

> **For Mikrotik RouterOS**:  
> Set **Disk Driver** to **IDE** to ensure compatibility.

---

## 🌐 Network Driver

Controls the emulated network interface:

- **Virtio (Recommended)**: High performance but requires drivers.
- **E1000**: Emulates an Intel network adapter. Compatible with most systems.
- **RTL8139**: Legacy option with broad compatibility but lower performance.

> **For Mikrotik RouterOS**:  
> Set **Network Driver** to **E1000** for the best compatibility.

## 🌍 VNC Keymap

The VNC Keymap ensures that the keyboard layout in your remote VNC session matches your physical keyboard. Common options include:

- **en-us** – US English
- **de** – German
- **fr** – French

Select the layout that corresponds to your local keyboard.

---

## 📝 Description

This is a free-text field where you can label your VPS with a custom name or note. It helps you organize and identify your servers in the client area.

Example: pro-webserver-ffm

---

## 🔒 VLAN Settings

If you have purchased the **Private VLAN** option, this dropdown lets you assign your VPS to a private VLAN. This provides secure, isolated networking between your VPS instances on the same host.

The dropdown will show the VLAN IDs available to your account.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:
- Changing any of these settings requires a **power-cycle** of your VPS to apply the changes.
- Use the recommended drivers for best performance unless specific compatibility (like with Mikrotik) is required.
