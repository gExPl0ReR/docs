## IPv6 address, subnet mask

Each VPS is automatically assigned its own /64 IPv6 subnet by EDIS. An IPv6 address from the assigned subnet is statically preconfigured on the interface.

To change the IPv6 address or add more addresses from the /64 assigned to your KVM, you'll need to use a manual configuration. The network setup is dependent on the operating system in use.

In Debian Linux you can work with the `ip` command.

<Note>
  Keep in mind that the **subnet mask must be configured as /48** and not /64.
</Note>

Configure an IPv6 address at runtime:

`ip -6 addr add 2a03:f80:ed15:435a::1/48 dev eth0`

Display configured IPv6 addresses

`ip -6 addr show`

## **IPv6 default route (IPv6 default gateway)**

To enable external IPv6 communication, a default route or default gateway must be configured.

Configure an IPv6 default route

`ip -6 route add default via 2a03:f80:ed15::1`

<Note>
  Every server location has its own IPv6 default route! Only use the address
  valid for your server location!
</Note>

Display configured IPv6 default route:

`ip -6 route show`
