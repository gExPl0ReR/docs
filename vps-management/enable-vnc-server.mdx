## VNC, remotely control a VPS through a graphical interface

### Understanding VNC

Imagine if you could sit in front of a remote computer from anywhere in the world and use it as if you're right there. That's VNC. It lets you see and interact with your VPS even if the normal ways of connecting (like SSH or RDP) are broken.

### Understanding noVNC

noVNC provides a convenient way to access VNC servers from any device with a modern web browser, eliminating the need for dedicated client software.

### How to activate VNC in the control panel

Through the KVM management portal, you can enable VNC for each VPS individually. Once VNC is turned on, **noVNC** or a **desktop VNC client** can be used to connect.
