## START / STOP and RESTART your VPS

If your service is currently in **SHUTDOWN** state, you can **START** your VPS.
Regardless of the current state, you always have the option to **Restart** (power-cycle) your VPS.

If your service is currently in **RUNNING** state, you can **STOP** (shutdown) your VPS.

### What it does

Both the **Stop** and **Restart** actions terminate the hypervisor process managing your VPS. In addition, a Restart also initiates a fresh start of your virtual machine on a new hypervisor process. if you had a VNC/noVNC console open, you need to restart VNC/noVNC console too.

### Alternative Solution (clean & safe)

You can trigger a **"shutdown -h now"** or **"halt"** at the command prompt of your OS, followed by a **"START"** through the KVM management portal. This should be the preferred way to give your machine a clean cold-boot.
