## Clean & Safe Shutdown (and Start)

You can trigger a shutdown with **"shutdown -h now"** or **"halt"** at the command prompt of your OS, followed by a **"START"** through the KVM management portal. This should be your preferred way to give your machine a clean cold-boot.

## Start / Stop and Restart Buttons

If your service is currently in **SHUTDOWN** state, you can **Start** your VPS.
Regardless of the current state, you always have the option to **Restart** your VPS.

If your service is currently in **RUNNING** state, you can **Stop** (Shutdown) your VPS.
You always have the option to **Restart** your VPS.

## Stop and Restart from a technical perspective

Both the **Stop** and **Restart** buttons terminate the hypervisor process which is managing your VPS. In addition, a Restart also initiates a fresh start of your virtual machine on a new hypervisor process. if you had a VNC/noVNC console open, you need to restart VNC/noVNC console too.
Please always consider a clean shutdown through your operating system first!
