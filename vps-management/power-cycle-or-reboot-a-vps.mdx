## How to power-cyle your VPS

You trigger a power-cycle or reboot of your VPS in the KVM management portal.

### How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title='Log in to your'>
    [VPS Management Portal](https://manage.edisglobal.com/clientarea.php)
  </Step>
  <Step title='Locate your VPS in the Services tab' />
  <Step title='Reinstall your VPS with a fresh OS and your own password'>
    and then click **"Shutdown"** or **"Reboot".** 

    After a shutdown, you can **"power on"** your VPS again.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### What it does

Both the Shutdown and Reboot actions terminate the hypervisor process managing your VPS, while a Reboot initiates a fresh start of your virtual machine with a new hypervisor process right after the process has ended.

### Alternative Solution (clean & safe)

Alternatively, you can trigger a **"shutdown -h now"** or **"halt"** at the command prompt of your OS, followed by a **"power on"** through the KVM management portal. This should be the preferred way to cleanly shutdown/reboot your system.&#x20;
