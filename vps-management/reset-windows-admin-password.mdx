### **Unmount the ISO**

Once the password is reset, make sure to [unmount the ISO](https://docs.edisglobal.com/enable-vnc-server) (Sysrescue CD) image. This can be done in the KVM management portal.

### **Reboot and Test**

After rebooting, Windows will automatically log in to the Administrator account without requesting a password. You need to open the CMD (Command Prompt) with administrative rights:

In the terminal window that opens, run the command:
```shell
net user Administrator newpassword
```
   Where:
   \- `Administrator` is the Administrator account in Windows that has full system control -`newstrongpassword` is a new password. ![](/assets/q7wiAyHP8mf8iXnKbh1HU_newpassword.png)

### Disable VNC access

Now close the **noVNC**(a tab window) and [disable VNC access](https://docs.edisglobal.com/enable-vnc-server) in the KVM management portal.

### ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You've successfully updated your Windows Administrator password. Now, try logging into the server with your new credentials. This is crucial to ensure that the password change took effect and that you have regained access to your server. Happy computing! :)
