## Background

Post-Install Scripts were a feature that allowed you to streamline your VPS server setup by pasting or uploading a script, which was then executed automatically after installation. This functionality has now been replaced by Cloud-Init, which provides a more standardized and powerful way of automating configuration during VPS installation.

## Archived Examples

Below are historical examples of Post-Install Scripts. They are **no longer supported**, but are shown here to help customers who may need to understand legacy configurations or migrate to Cloud-Init equivalents.

### **For Debian-based OS (Debian/Ubuntu)**

_(archived example)_

The following script was successfully tested on Debian 12. 
This script performs the following operations on a Debian-based OS (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali Linux, Raspbian, Pop!\_OS, MX Linux, Deepin): 

1. Disables password authentication for the root user, allowing only SSH key authentication.
2. Changes the default SSH port from 22 to 10022 and restarts the SSH daemon to apply the changes.
3. Updates the system packages, upgrades existing packages, and installs the components of a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP).
4. Sends a notification through Pushover (a notification service) indicating that the post-installation script has completed, along with the server's IP address.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Disable root password access, restrict to SSH key authentication only
sed -i '/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/c\PermitRootLogin prohibit-password' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Change default SSH port from 22 to 10022
sed -i '/#Port 22/c\Port 10022' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart sshd

# Start LAMP installer
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install -y apache2
apt-get install -y curl wget unzip
apt-get install -y mariadb-server
apt-get install -y php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql

# Send Pushover notification (optional)
token="token=your-pushover-token-goes-here"
user="user=your-pushover-username-goes-here"
IP=`hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'`
curl -s --form-string $token --form-string $user --form-string 'message=Post installation script finished on server with IP: $IP. Have fun' https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json
```

This below example post install script performs the installation oft a simple firewall.
This script does three main things:

1. It installs a firewall tool called UFW (uncomplicated firewall)
2. It sets up rules in the firewall to allow incoming connections for SSH on port 22, web traffic on port 80, and secure web traffic on port 443.
3. It turns the firewall on with these rules in place.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Install UFW
apt-get install -y ufw

# Allow SSH and HTTP/HTTPS traffic
ufw allow 22/tcp # Remember the SSH port was changed to 10022
ufw allow 80/tcp
ufw allow 443/tcp

# Enable the firewall
ufw enable
```

The length of our Post Install Scripts is unrestricted. You can combine and tailor them to create intricate setup processes and streamline your deployment.

### **For RPM-based OS (CentOS, Rocky Linux, ...)**

_(archived example)_

The following script performs several actions on a RPM-based OS (RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, openSUSE, SLES, Oracle Linux, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux)

1. **SSH Configuration**

   It restricts root login to SSH key authentication only, disabling password access. It then restarts the SSH daemon to apply these changes.
2. **LAMP Stack Installation**:
   Updates the system packages.
   Installs necessary utilities: curl, wget, and unzip.
   Installs and starts the Apache web server, and ensures it starts on boot.
   Installs and starts the MariaDB server, and ensures it starts on boot.
   Installs PHP along with some additional modules.
3. **Notification (optional)**

   Sends a notification via the Pushover service, indicating that the post-installation script has completed and providing the IP address of the server.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Disable root password access, restrict to SSH key authentication only
sed -i '/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/c\PermitRootLogin prohibit-password' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart sshd

# Start LAMP installer
dnf -y update
dnf -y install curl wget unzip
dnf -y install httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
dnf -y install mariadb-server
systemctl start mariadb
systemctl enable mariadb
dnf -y install php php-cli php-common php-gd php-mysqlnd php-pdo

# Send Pushover notification (optional)
token="token=your-pushover-token-goes-here"
user="user=your-pushover-username-goes-here"
IP=`hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'`
curl -s --form-string $token --form-string $user --form-string 'message=Post installation script finished on server with IP: $IP. Have fun' https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json
```
