## Installation Time & Port Behavior

Once the reinstallation starts, your VPS will go through the automated setup process.  
The following table shows how long it usually takes for each operating system:

| OS | Time | Port Behavior |
|----|------|----------------|
| **Linux** | <p align="center"><img src="/assets/huaNpFAxK5PVCl_NLo3ID-qDPCEUD7wtL6EYnFUKOfe-20241001-201404.png" alt="Linux install 5 min" width="52"><br>≈ 5 min<br><span style="font-size:0.85em;color:#666;">Auto-install in progress</span></p> | SSH **22** is closed during installation. |
| **Windows** | <p align="center"><img src="/assets/huaNpFAxK5PVCl_NLo3ID-ozGQ3EbLw2SKc3sattPPn-20241001-201443.png" alt="Windows install 15 min" width="52"><br>≈ 15 min<br><span style="font-size:0.85em;color:#666;">Preparing Windows image</span></p> | RDP **3389** is closed during installation. |

<Note>
During reinstallation, **remote access (SSH/RDP)** is temporarily disabled while your VPS is being rebuilt.  
You’ll be able to connect again once the installation has finished — typically after  
**≈ 5 minutes for Linux** or **≈ 15 minutes for Windows**.
⚠️ **Do not power off or reboot your VPS** during this time, as it may interrupt the OS setup.
