|---|---|---|
| **Linux** | <div style={{textAlign:"center"}}><img src="/assets/huaNpFAxK5PVCl_NLo3ID-qDPCEUD7wtL6EYnFUKOfe-20241001-201404.png" alt="Linux install 5 min" style={{width:"52px",marginBottom:"4px"}} /><br/>≈ 5 min</div> | SSH **22** is closed during installation. |

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
  During reinstallation, **remote access (SSH/RDP)** is temporarily disabled while your VPS is being rebuilt.  
  You’ll be able to connect again **once the installation has completed** — usually after about  
  **5 minutes for Linux** and **15 minutes for Windows**.

  ⚠️ **Do not power off or reboot your VPS** during this process, as it may interrupt the OS setup.
