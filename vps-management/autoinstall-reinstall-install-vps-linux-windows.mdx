## Turnkey Images

Turnkey images are pre-configured system snapshots that include an operating system and essential software, all set up and ready to be deployed immediately, akin to a product that's ready to use right out of the box. These images facilitate quick and easy setup for users who want to run servers or applications without going through the hassle of manual installation and configuration.

EDIS Global offers these Turnkey images to their clients by sourcing them directly from the official Turnkey Linux website. This process occurs in real-time during the client's system setup, ensuring that the images are up-to-date with the latest versions and security updates. This method of on-the-fly downloading helps maintain the integrity and currency of the software being installed.

## How to Install a Turnkey Image

After the initial installation process of a Turkey image is initiated, the Turnkey image will be downloaded from the source and deployed on your VPS. Finish the installation in a VNC session.
